            "text": "Overview\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn the following few pages, we will walk through an example of making a simple, working plugin.\n\n\nOur plugin will virtualize simple directory trees on Unix systems. The actual contents of these directories could be anything: configuration files, documents, image libraries, etc. Our plugin will not care about the contents and will treat it as a directory tree full of files.\n\n\nData Flow in the Delphix Engine\n\u00b6\n\n\nHere we will briefly overview how data moves through the Delphix Engine.\n\n\nIngestion\n\u00b6\n\n\nIt all begins with Delphix ingesting data\u2014copying some data from what we call a \nsource environment\n  onto the Delphix Engine.\n\n\nPlugins can use either of two basic strategies to do this copying:\n\n\n\n\ndirect linking\n, where the Delphix Engine pulls data directly from the source environment.\n\n\nstaged linking\n, where the plugin is responsible for pulling data from the source environment.\n\n\n\n\nOur plugin will use the staged linking strategy.\n\n\nWith staged linking, Delphix exposes and mounts storage to a \nstaging environment\n.  This would be an NFS share for Unix environments and iSCSI disks for Windows environments. You can use either the source environment or a different environment for staging. We will write our plugin to handle both approaches.\n\n\nOnce Delphix mounts the storage share onto the staging environment, the plugin needs to arrange for the relevant data to be copied from the source environment onto the storage share, which is backed by Delphix Engine storage.\n\n\nWhen this initial copy is complete, Delphix will take a snapshot of the backing storage.\n\n\nThis same basic operation will be repeated when Delphix mounts an NFS share: The plugin copies data onto it, then Delphix snapshots the result.\n\n\nProvisioning\n\u00b6\n\n\nProvisioning\n is when you take a Delphix Engine snapshot and create a virtual dataset from it.\n\n\nFirst the snapshot is cloned onto the Delphix Engine, then this newly-cloned data is mounted as a virtual dataset onto a \ntarget environment\n. While this new virtual dataset gets updated by its end users, the original snapshot is persistent. You can use it in a few ways:\n\n\n\n\nProvision other virtual datasets from it\n\n\nRewind the virtual dataset back to the state it represents\n\n\nCreate a physical database from it in what we call V2P: Virtual to Physical\n\n\n\n\nParts of a Plugin\n\u00b6\n\n\nA plugin consists of three main parts. We will cover them briefly here, and then fill in more details later in the tutorial.\n\n\nPlugin Config\n\u00b6\n\n\nPlugin config is where the plugin describes itself to the Delphix Engine. What is the plugin called? What version of the plugin is being used? What type(s) of environments does the plugin work with? What features does the plugin offer?...\n\n\nPlugin Operations\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe plugin will need to provide operations. These are Python functions, each of which implements one small piece of functionality. This is how the plugin customizes Delphix behavior to work with the kind of dataset you\u2019re building the plugin for. One operation will handle setting up a newly-configured virtual dataset. Another will handle copying data from a source environment, and so on.\n\n\nLater we\u2019ll provide examples for our first plugin. See \nPlugin Operations\n for full details on the operations that are available, which are required, and what each one is required to do.\n\n\nSchemas\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs part of normal operations, plugins need to generate and access certain pieces of information in order to do their job. For example, plugins that work with Postgres might need to know which port number to connect to, or which credentials to use.\n\n\nDefining your plugin\u2019s schemas will enable it to give the Delphix Engine the details it needs to run the operations we\u2019ve built into it. Different datasets can have very different needs. The \nschemas\n you provide for your plugin will tell Delphix how to operate with your dataset.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo complete the tutorial that follows, make sure you check off the things on this list:\n\n\n\n\nDownload the SDK and get it working\n\n\nA running Delphix Engine version 6.0.2.0 or above.\n\n\nAdd at least one Unix host\u2014but preferably three\u2014to the Delphix Engine as remote environments.\n\n\nHave a tool at hand for editing text files\u2014mostly Python and JSON. A simple text editor would work fine, or you can use a full-fledged IDE.",

Type \ndvp -h\n and you should see something like the following:\n\n\n(venv)$ dvp -h\nUsage: dvp [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\n  The tools of the Delphix Virtualization SDK that help develop, build, and\n  upload a plugin.\n\nOptions:\n  --version      Show the version and exit.\n  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose mode.

            "text": "Discovery\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhat is Discovery?\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to ingest data from a source environment, the Delphix Engine first needs to learn information about the data: Where does it live? How can it be accessed? What is it called?\n\n\nDiscovery\n is the process by which the Delphix Engine learns about remote data. Discovery can be either:\n\n\n\n\nautomatic\n \u2014 where the plugin finds the remote data on its own\n\n\nmanual\n \u2014 where the user tells us about the remote data\n\n\n\n\nFor our first plugin, we will be using a mix of these two techniques.\n\n\nSource Configs and Repositories\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhat are Source Configs and Repositories?\n\u00b6\n\n\nA \nsource config\n is a collection of information that Delphix uses to represent a dataset. Different plugins will have different ideas about what a \"dataset\" is (an entire database? a set of config files? an application?). For our first plugin, it is simply a directory tree on the filesystem of the remote environment.\n\n\nA \nrepository\n represents what you might call \"data dependencies\" -- anything installed on the remote host that the dataset depends on. For example, if you are working with a Postgres database, then your repository will represent an installation of a particular version of the Postgres DBMS. In this plugin, we do not have any special dependencies, except for the simple existence of the unix system on which the directory lives.\n\n\nWe will be using automatic discovery for our repositories, and manual discovery for our source configs. This is the default configuration that is created by \ndvp init\n, so there is nothing further we need to do here.\n\n\nDefining Your Data Formats\n\u00b6\n\n\nBecause each plugin will have different ideas about what a repository or source config represents, different plugins will have different sets of information that they need to collect and store.\n\n\nDelphix needs to know the format of this information. How many pieces of information are collected? What are they called? Are they strings? Numbers?\n\n\nFor our first plugin, we do not need a lot of information. We use no special information about our repositories (except some way for the user to identify them). For source configs, all we need to know is the path to the directory from which we will be ingesting data.\n\n\nThe plugin needs to describe all of this to the Delphix Engine, and it does so using \nschemas\n.  Recall that when we ran \ndvp init\n, a file full of bare-bones schemas was created. As we build up our first toolkit, we will be augmenting these schemas to serve our needs.\n\n\nRepository Schema\n\u00b6\n\n\nOpen up the \nschema.json\n file in your editor/IDE and locate \nrepositoryDefinition\n, it should look like this:\n\n\n{\n\n    \n\"repositoryDefinition\"\n:\n \n{\n\n        \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"object\"\n,\n\n        \n\"properties\"\n:\n \n{\n\n            \n\"name\"\n:\n \n{\n \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n \n}\n\n        \n},\n\n        \n\"nameField\"\n:\n \n\"name\"\n,\n\n        \n\"identityFields\"\n:\n \n[\n\"name\"\n]\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we do not have any special dependencies, we can just leave it as-is.\n\n\nFor detailed information about exactly how repository schemas work, see \nthe reference page\n.\n\n\nIn brief, what we are doing here is saying that each of our repositories will have a single property called \nname\n, which will be used both as a unique identifier and as the user-visible name of the repository.\n\n\nSource Config Schema\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor source configs, the bare-bones schema is not going to be good enough. Recall that for us, a source config represents a directory tree on a remote environment.\n\n\nLocate the \nsourceConfigDefinition\n inside the \nschema.json\n file and modify the definition so it looks like this:\n\n\n\"sourceConfigDefinition\"\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"object\"\n,\n\n    \n\"required\"\n:\n \n[\n\"name\"\n,\n \n\"path\"\n],\n\n    \n\"additionalProperties\"\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n    \n\"properties\"\n:\n \n{\n\n        \n\"name\"\n:\n \n{\n\n          \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n,\n\n          \n\"prettyName\"\n:\n \n\"Dataset Name\"\n,\n\n          \n\"description\"\n:\n \n\"User-visible name for this dataset\"\n\n        \n},\n\n        \n\"path\"\n:\n \n{\n\n          \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n,\n\n          \n\"format\"\n:\n \n\"unixpath\"\n,\n\n          \n\"prettyName\"\n:\n \n\"Path\"\n,\n\n          \n\"description\"\n:\n \n\"Full path to data location on the remote environment\"\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n\"nameField\"\n:\n \n\"name\"\n,\n\n    \n\"identityFields\"\n:\n \n[\n\"path\"\n]\n\n\n}\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we have two properties, a property \nname\n serving as the user-visible name of the source config and \npath\n which tells us where the data lives on the remote host. Note  we are using \npath\n as the unique identifier.\n\n\nBecause we are using manual discovery, the end user is going to be responsible for filling in values for \nname\n and \npath\n. So, we have added some things to our schema that we did not need for repositories.\n\n\nThe \nprettyName\n and \ndescription\n entries will be used by the UI to tell the user what these fields mean.\n\n\nBecause we set \nadditionalProperties\n to \nfalse\n, this will prevent users from supplying properties other than \nname\n and \npath\n.\n\n\nFinally, we have specified that the \npath\n property must be a well-formatted Unix path. This allows the UI to enforce that the format is correct before the user is allowed to proceed. (Note this only enforces the format, and does not actually check to see if the path really exists on some remote environment!)\n\n\nRefer to the reference page for \nSchemas\n for more details about these entries, and for other things that you can do in these schemas.\n\n\nImplementing Discovery in Your Plugin\n\u00b6\n\n\nAbout Python Code\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs described in the overview section, plugins customize the behavior of the Delphix Engine by providing Python code. Each customizable piece of behavior is called a \"plugin operation\". The plugin provides separate Python functions for each of the operations that it wants to customize.\n\n\nRight now, we are concerned with discovery. There are two customizable operations related to automatic discovery, one for repositories and one for source configs. In both cases, the job of the Python method is to automatically collect whatever information the schemas (see above) require, and to return that information to the Delphix Engine. The Delphix Engine will run these customized operations whenever a new environment is added, or when an existing environment is rediscovered.\n\n\nA Look at the Generated Code\n\u00b6\n\n\nRecall that the \ndvp init\n command we ran created a file called \nsrc/plugin_runner.py\n. Open this file in your editor/IDE. You will see that this file already contains a bunch of Python code. Let's take a look at the first three blocks of code in this file.\n\n\nfrom\n \ndlpx.virtualization.platform\n \nimport\n \nMount\n,\n \nMountSpecification\n,\n \nPlugin\n\n\n\nfrom\n \ngenerated.definitions\n \nimport\n \n(\n\n    \nRepositoryDefinition\n,\n\n    \nSourceConfigDefinition\n,\n\n    \nSnapshotDefinition\n,\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese \nimport\n lines make certain functionality available to our Python code. Some of this functionality will\nbe used just below, as we implement discovery. Others will be used later on, as we implement\ningestion and provisioning. Later, you'll add more \nimport\ns to unlock more functionality.\n\n\nplugin\n \n=\n \nPlugin\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis line creates a Python object which allows us to define our plugin types. We have the ability to do this because of the \nimport Plugin\n statement above.\n\n\nThis object is stored in a variable we have elected to call \nplugin\n. We are free to call this variable anything we want, so long as we also change the \nentryPoint\n line in the \nplugin_config.yml\n file. For this example, we will just leave it as \nplugin\n.\n\n\n#\n\n\n# Below is an example of the repository discovery operation.\n\n\n#\n\n\n# NOTE: The decorators are defined on the 'plugin' object created above.\n\n\n#\n\n\n# Mark the function below as the operation that does repository discovery.\n\n\n@plugin\n.\ndiscovery\n.\nrepository\n()\n\n\ndef\n \nrepository_discovery\n(\nsource_connection\n):\n\n    \n#\n\n    \n# This is an object generated from the repositoryDefinition schema.\n\n    \n# In order to use it locally you must run the 'build -g' command provided\n\n    \n# by the SDK tools from the plugin's root directory.\n\n    \n#\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \n[\nRepositoryDefinition\n(\nname\n=\n'1e87dc30-3cdb-4f0a-9634-07ce017d20d1'\n)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is our first \nplugin operation\n. In this case, it's defining what will happen when the Delphix Engine wants to discover repositories on an environment.  Let's take a look at this code line-by-line\n\n\n@plugin\n.\ndiscovery\n.\nrepository\n()\n\n\ndef\n \nrepository_discovery\n(\nsource_connection\n):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis begins the definition of a function called \nrepository_discovery\n.\n\n\nWe are using a Python \ndecorator\n which signals to the Delphix Engine that this is the function which should be called when it is time to do repository discovery. The actual name of the function doesn't matter here. Note that we are using our \nplugin\n variable here as part of the decorator.\n\n\nThe Delphix Engine will pass us information about the source environment in an argument called \nsource_connection\n.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThe name of this input argument matters. That is, you'll always need to have an argument called\n\nsource_connection\n here. Each plugin operation has its own set of required argument names. For\ndetails on which arguments apply to which operations, see the \nreference section\n.\n\n\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \n[\nRepositoryDefinition\n(\nname\n=\n'1e87dc30-3cdb-4f0a-9634-07ce017d20d1'\n)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis creates and returns a Python object that corresponds to the format defined by our repository schema. Because our repository has exactly one string property called \nname\n, therefore this Python object has one property called \nname\n.\n\n\nNotice that the code generator has filled in the value of \nname\n with a random string. This results in a plugin operation that works, but which will not be very helpful for the user. We'll change this later.\n\n\nThe rest of the file contains more plugin operations, and we'll be modifying them later.\n\n\nRepository Discovery\n\u00b6\n\n\nNow, we need to modify the provided \nrepository discovery\n operation. This operation will examine a remote environment, find any repositories, and return information about them to the Delphix Engine.\n\n\nAs a reminder, our only external dependency on the remote environment is simply the existence of a filesystem. Since every Unix host has a filesystem, that means we will have exactly one repository per remote environment. Therefore, our repository discovery operation can be very simple.\n\n\nIn fact, as we saw above, the default-generated \nrepository_discovery\n function does almost exactly what we want -- it returns one single repository for any Unix host that it is asked to work with. The only problem with it is that it uses\nunhelpful name.  That's really easy to change!\n\n\nReplace or modify \nrepository_discovery\n so it looks like this:\n\n\n@plugin\n.\ndiscovery\n.\nrepository\n()\n\n\ndef\n \nrepository_discovery\n(\nsource_connection\n):\n\n    \nrepository\n \n=\n \nRepositoryDefinition\n(\n'Repository for our First Plugin'\n)\n\n    \nreturn\n \n[\nrepository\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nBe careful to always use consistent indentation in Python code!\n\n\n\n\nSource Config Discovery\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor source configs, we will rely solely on manual discovery. Therefore, the user will tell us which directories they want to ingest from. We still have to define a source config discovery operation -- it just won't need to do much.\n\n\nThe job of this operation is to return only source configs associated with the given \nrepository\n. This function will be called once per repository. In our case, that means it will only be called once.\n\n\nBecause we want to supply \nno\n automatically-discovered source configs, this function should simply returns an empty list.\n\n\nIn fact, \ndvp init\n has already generated a function for us that does exactly this.\n\n\n@plugin\n.\ndiscovery\n.\nsource_config\n()\n\n\ndef\n \nsource_config_discovery\n(\nsource_connection\n,\n \nrepository\n):\n\n    \nreturn\n \n[]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we wanted to do automatic discovery of source configs, we'd modify this function. But, for our purposes now, the existing code is fine and we don't need to change anything.\n\n\nHow to Run Discovery in the Delphix Engine\n\u00b6\n\n\nLet us make sure discovery works!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the \ndvp build\n commands, as before. This will build the plugin, with all of the new changes, and create an artifact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \ndvp upload -e <engine> -u <user>\n, as before. This will get all the new changes onto the Delphix Engine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the new plugin is uploaded, add a remote unix environment to your engine. To do this, go to \nManage > Environments\n, chose \nAdd Environment\n from the menu, answer the questions, and \nSubmit\n. (If you already have an environment set up, you can just refresh it instead).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo keep an eye on this discovery process, you may need to open the \nActions\n tab on the UI. If any errors happen, they will be reported here.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the automatic discovery process completes, go to the \nDatabases\n tab. You will see an entry for \nRepository For Our First Plugin\n. This is the repository you created in your Python code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that it says \nNo databases found on installation\n. This is because we chose not to do automatic source config discovery.\n\n\nHowever, because we have allowed manual source config discovery, you can add your own entries by clicking the plus sign (\nAdd Database\n). Complete the information in the Add Database dialog and click Add.\n\n\n\n\nThis should all look familiar. It is precisely what we defined in our source config schema. As expected, there are two entries, one for our \nname\n property, and one for \npath\n.\n\n\nFor example, in the above screenshot, we are specifying that we want to sync the \n/bin\n directory\nfrom the remote host, and we want to call it \nBinaries\n. You can pick any directory and name that\nyou want.\n\n\nOnce you have added one or more source configs, you will be able to sync. This is covered on the next page.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nOnce you have automatically or manually created source configs, you will not be allowed to modify your plugin's source config schema. We will cover how to deal with this later in the \nupgrade section\n. For now, if you need to change your plugin's source config schema:\n\n\n\n\nYou will have to delete any source configs you have manually added.\n\n\nDelete the plugin and its corresponding objects (dSources, Virtual Sources, etc) if the source configs were manually discovered.",

In both cases, the job of the Python method is to automatically collect whatever information the schemas (see above) require, and to return that information to the Delphix Engine.

Some of this functionality will\nbe used just below, as we implement discovery. Others will be used later on, as we implement\ningestion and provisioning. Later, you'll add more  import s to unlock more functionality.  plugin   =   Plugin ()   This line creates a Python object which allows us to define our plugin types. We have the ability to do this because of the  import Plugin  statement above.  This object is stored in a variable we have elected to call  plugin . We are free to call this variable anything we want, so long as we also change the  entryPoint  line in the  plugin_config.yml  file. For this example, we will just leave it as  plugin .  #  # Below is an example of the repository discovery operation.  #  # NOTE: The decorators are defined on the 'plugin' object created above.  #  # Mark the function below as the operation that does repository discovery.  @plugin . discovery . repository ()  def   repository_discovery ( source_connection ): \n     # \n     # This is an object generated from the repositoryDefinition schema. \n     # In order to use it locally you must run the 'build -g' command provided \n     # by the SDK tools from the plugin's root directory. \n     # \n\n     return   [ RepositoryDefinition ( name = '1e87dc30-3cdb-4f0a-9634-07ce017d20d1' )]   This is our first  plugin operation .

Let's take a look at this code line-by-line  @plugin . discovery . repository ()  def   repository_discovery ( source_connection ):   This begins the definition of a function called  repository_discovery .  We are using a Python  decorator  which signals to the Delphix Engine that this is the function which should be called when it is time to do repository discovery. The actual name of the function doesn't matter here. Note that we are using our  plugin  variable here as part of the decorator.  The Delphix Engine will pass us information about the source environment in an argument called  source_connection .   Warning  The name of this input argument matters. That is, you'll always need to have an argument called source_connection  here. Each plugin operation has its own set of required argument names. For\ndetails on which arguments apply to which operations, see the  reference section .        return   [ RepositoryDefinition ( name = '1e87dc30-3cdb-4f0a-9634-07ce017d20d1' )]   This creates and returns a Python object that corresponds to the format defined by our repository schema. Because our repository has exactly one string property called  name , therefore this Python object has one property called  name .  Notice that the code generator has filled in the value of  name  with a random string. This results in a plugin operation that works, but which will not be very helpful for the user. We'll change this later.  The rest of the file contains more plugin operations, and we'll be modifying them later.",

To keep an eye on this discovery process, you may need to open the  Actions  tab on the UI. If any errors happen, they will be reported here.

            "location": "/Building_Your_First_Plugin/Data_Ingestion/",
            "text": "Data Ingestion\n\u00b6\n\n\nHow Does Delphix Ingest Data?\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs \npreviously\n discussed, the Delphix Engine uses the \ndiscovery\n process to learn about datasets that live on a \nsource environment\n. In this section we will learn how the Delphix Engine uses a two-step process to ingest a dataset.\n\n\nLinking\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe first step is called \nlinking\n. This is simply the creation of a new dataset on the Delphix Engine, which is associated with the dataset on the source environment. This new linked dataset is called a \ndSource\n.\n\n\nSyncing\n\u00b6\n\n\nImmediately after linking, the new dSource is \nsynced\n for the first time. Syncing is a process by which data from the source environment is copied onto the Delphix Engine. Subsequent syncs may then be periodically performed in order to keep the dSource up-to-date.\n\n\nThe details of how this is done varies significantly from plugin to plugin. For example, some plugins will simply copy files from the filesystem. Other plugins might contact a DBMS and instruct it to send backup or replication streams. There are many possibilities here, but they all break down into two main strategies that the plugin author can choose from: direct and staging.\n\n\nWith the \ndirect\n strategy, the plugin is not in charge\nof the data copying. Instead the Delphix Engine directly pulls raw data from the source environment.\nThe plugin merely provides the location of the data. This is a very simple strategy, and is also\nquite limiting.\n\n\nFor our first plugin, we will be using the more flexible \nstaging\n strategy. With this strategy, the Delphix Engine uses NFS for Unix environments (or iSCSI on Windows environments) to mount storage onto a \nstaging environment\n. Our plugin will then be in full control of how to get data from the source environment onto this storage mount.\n\n\nWith the staging strategy, there are two types of syncs: sync and resync. A \nsync\n is used to ingest incremental changes while a \nresync\n is used to re-ingest all the data for the dSource. For databases, this could mean re-ingesting from a full database backup to reset the dSource. A \nsync\n and a \nresync\n will execute the same plugin operations. To differentiate a \nsync\n from a \nresync\n, simply add a boolean property (i.e. \nresync\n) in the plugin's \nsnapshot parameters definition\n. Once \nsync\n or \nresync\n is selected, the property will be passed into \nlinked.pre_snapshot\n and \nlinked.post_snapshot\n as a \nsnapshot parameter\n.\n\n\nA regular \nsync\n is the default and is executed as part of policy driven syncs. A \nresync\n is only executed during initial ingestion or if the Delphix user manually starts one. The customer can manually trigger a \nresync\n via the UI by selecting the dSource, going to more options and selecting \nResynchronize dSource\n. \n\n\n\n\nGotcha\n\n\nAlthough it is not common, it is entirely possible that the staging environment is the same as the source environment. Be careful not to assume otherwise in your plugins.\n\n\n\n\nOur Syncing Strategy\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor our purposes here in this intro plugin, we will use a simple strategy. We won't do anything with the resync snapshot parameter and simply copy files from the filesystem on the source environment onto the NFS mount on the staging environment. We will do this by running the Unix tool \nrsync\n from our staging environment, and rely on passwordless SSH to connect to the source environment.\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nThis plugin is assuming that \nrsync\n is installed on the staging host, and that the staging\nhost user is able to SSH into the source host without having to type in a password. A more\nfull-featured plugin would test these assumptions, usually as part of discovery.\n\n\n\n\nIn the special case mentioned above, where the staging environment is the same as the source environment, we could likely do something more efficient. However, for simplicity's sake, we won't do that here.\n\n\nDefining Your Linked Source Data Format\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to be able to successfully do the copying required, plugins might need to get some information from the end-user of your plugin. In our case, we need to tell \nrsync\n how to access the files. This means we need to know the source environment's IP address (or domain name), the username we need to connect as, and finally the location where the files live.\n\n\nAgain, we will be using a JSON schema to define the data format. The user will be presented with a UI that lets them provide all the information our schema specifies.\n\n\nOpen up \nschema.json\n in your editor/IDE. Locate the \nLinkedSourceDefinition\n and replace it with the following schema:\n\n\n\"linkedSourceDefinition\"\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"object\"\n,\n\n    \n\"additionalProperties\"\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n    \n\"required\"\n:\n \n[\n\"sourceAddress\"\n,\n \n\"username\"\n,\n \n\"mountLocation\"\n],\n\n    \n\"properties\"\n:\n \n{\n\n        \n\"sourceAddress\"\n:\n \n{\n\n            \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n,\n\n            \n\"prettyName\"\n:\n \n\"Host from which to copy\"\n,\n\n            \n\"description\"\n:\n \n\"IP or FQDN of host from which to copy\"\n\n        \n},\n\n        \n\"username\"\n:\n \n{\n\n            \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n,\n\n            \n\"prettyName\"\n:\n \n\"Username on Source Host\"\n,\n\n            \n\"description\"\n:\n \n\"Username for making SSH connection to source host\"\n\n        \n},\n\n        \n\"mountLocation\"\n:\n \n{\n\n            \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n,\n\n            \n\"format\"\n:\n \n\"unixpath\"\n,\n\n            \n\"prettyName\"\n:\n \n\"Mount Location on Staging Host\"\n,\n\n            \n\"description\"\n:\n \n\"Where to mount storage onto the staging host while syncing\"\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nAs will be explained later, this schema will be used to generate Python code.\nAll names in the autogenerated Python code will use \nlower_case_with_underscores\n as attribute names as per Python variable naming conventions.\nThat is, if we were to use \nmountLocation\n as the schema property name, it would be called\n\nmount_location\n in the generated Python code.\n\n\n\n\nWith this schema, the user will be required to provide the source username, the source's IP address, and the staging mount location as part of the linking process.\n\n\nImplementing Syncing in Your Plugin\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere are three things we must do to implement syncing. First, we need to tell the Delphix Engine\nwhere to mount storage onto the staging environment. Next we need to actually do the work of copying\ndata onto that mounted storage. Finally, we need to generate any snapshot-related data.\n\n\nMount Specification\n\u00b6\n\n\nBefore syncing can begin, the Delphix Engine needs to mount some storage onto the staging host.\nSince different plugins can have different requirements about where exactly this mount lives, it is\nup to the plugin to specify this location. As mentioned above, our simple plugin will get this\nlocation from the user.\n\n\nOpen up the \nplugin_runner.py\n file and find the \nlinked_mount_specification\n function (which was generated by \ndvp init\n). Replace it with the following code:\n\n\n@plugin.linked.mount_specification()\ndef linked_mount_specification(staged_source, repository):\n    mount_location = staged_source.parameters.mount_location\n    mount = Mount(staged_source.staged_connection.environment, mount_location)\n    return MountSpecification([mount])\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's take this line-by-line to see what's going on here.\n\n\n@plugin.linked.mount_specification()\n\n\n\n\n\nThis \ndecorator\n announces that the following function\nis the code that handles the \nmount_specification\n operation. This is what allows the Delphix\nEngine to know which function to call when it's time to learn where to mount. Every operation\ndefinition will begin with a similar decorator.\n\n\ndef linked_mount_specification(staged_source, repository):\n\n\n\n\n\nThis begins a Python function definition. We chose to call it \nlinked_mount_specification\n, but we\ncould have chosen any name at all. This function accepts two arguments, one giving information about\nthe linked source, and one giving information about the associated repository.\n\n\n    mount_location = staged_source.parameters.mount_location\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nstaged_source\n input argument contains an attribute called \nparameters\n. This in turn contains\nall of the properties defined by the \nlinkedSourceDefinition\n schema. So, in our case, that means\nit will contain attributes called \nsource_address\n, \nusername\n, and \nmount_location\n. Note how any attribute defined in \ncamelCase\n in the schema is converted to \nvariable_with_underscores\n. This line\nsimply retrieves the user-provided mount location and saves it in a local variable.\n\n\n    mount = Mount(staged_source.staged_connection.environment, mount_location)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis line constructs a new object from the \nMount class\n. This class\nholds details about how Delphix Engine storage is mounted onto remote environments. Here, we\ncreate a mount object that says to mount onto the staging environment, at the location specified\nby the user.\n\n\n    return MountSpecification([mount])\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the line just before this one, we created an object that describes a \nsingle\n mount. Now, we\nmust return a full \nmount specification\n. In general,\na mount specification is a collection of mounts. But, in our case, we just have one single mount.\nTherefore, we use an array with only one item it in -- namely, the one single mount object we\ncreated just above.\n\n\nData Copying\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs explained \nhere\n, the Delphix Engine will always run the plugin's \npreSnapshot\n operation just before taking a snapshot of the dsource. That means our \npreSnapshot\n operation has to get the NFS share into the desired state. For us, that means that's the time to do our data copy.\n\n\nUnlike the previous operations we've seen so far, the pre-snapshot operation will not be autogenerated by \ndvp init\n.\nSo, we will need to add one ourselves.  Open up the \nplugin_runner.py\n file.\n\n\nFirst, we'll add a new import line near the top of the file, so that we can use Delphix's platform libraries and raise user visible errors (explained below).\n\n\nfrom\n \ndlpx.virtualization\n \nimport\n \nlibs\n\n\nfrom\n \ndlpx.virtualization.platform.exceptions\n \nimport\n \nUserError\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we'll add a new function:\n\n\n@plugin\n.\nlinked\n.\npre_snapshot\n()\n\n\ndef\n \ncopy_data_from_source\n(\nstaged_source\n,\n \nrepository\n,\n \nsource_config\n,\n \noptional_snapshot_parameters\n):\n\n    \nstage_mount_path\n \n=\n \nstaged_source\n.\nmount\n.\nmount_path\n\n    \ndata_location\n \n=\n \n\"\n{}\n@\n{}\n:\n{}\n\"\n.\nformat\n(\nstaged_source\n.\nparameters\n.\nusername\n,\n\n        \nstaged_source\n.\nparameters\n.\nsource_address\n,\n\n        \nsource_config\n.\npath\n)\n\n\n    \nrsync_command\n \n=\n \n\"rsync -r \n{}\n \n{}\n\"\n.\nformat\n(\ndata_location\n,\n \nstage_mount_path\n)\n\n\n    \nresult\n \n=\n \nlibs\n.\nrun_bash\n(\nstaged_source\n.\nstaged_connection\n,\n \nrsync_command\n)\n\n\n    \nif\n \nresult\n.\nexit_code\n \n!=\n \n0\n:\n\n        \nraise\n \nUserError\n(\n\n            \n\"Could not copy files.\"\n,\n\n            \n\"Ensure that passwordless SSH works for \n{}\n.\"\n.\nformat\n(\nstaged_source\n.\nparameters\n.\nsource_address\n),\n\n            \nresult\n.\nstderr\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's walk through this function and see what's going on\n\n\n    \nstage_mount_path\n \n=\n \nstaged_source\n.\nmount\n.\nmount_path\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nstaged_source\n argument contains information about the current mount location. Here we save that\nto a local variable for convenience.\n\n\n    \ndata_location\n \n=\n \n\"\n{}\n@\n{}\n:\n{}\n\"\n.\nformat\n(\nstaged_source\n.\nparameters\n.\nusername\n,\n\n        \nstaged_source\n.\nparameters\n.\nsource_address\n,\n\n        \nsource_config\n.\npath\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code creates a Python string that represents the location of the data that we want to ingest.\nThis is in the form \n<user>@<host>:<path>\n. For example \njdoe@sourcehost.mycompany.com:/bin\n. As\nbefore with \nmountLocation\n, we have defined our schemas such that these three pieces of information\nwere provided by the user. Here we're just putting them into a format that \nrsync\n will understand.\n\n\n    \nrsync_command\n \n=\n \n\"rsync -r \n{}\n \n{}\n\"\n.\nformat\n(\ndata_location\n,\n \nstage_mount_path\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis line is the actual Bash command that we'll be running on the staging host. This will look something like \nrsync -r user@host:/source/path /staging/mount/path\n.\n\n\n    \nresult\n \n=\n \nlibs\n.\nrun_bash\n(\nstaged_source\n.\nstaged_connection\n,\n \nrsync_command\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a \nplatform library\n function, where we ask the Virtualization Platform\nto do some work on our behalf. In this case, we're asking the platform to run our Bash command on the\nstaging environment. For full details on the \nrun_bash\n platform library function and others, see this \nreference\n.\n\n\n    \nif\n \nresult\n.\nexit_code\n \n!=\n \n0\n:\n\n        \nraise\n \nUserError\n(\n\n            \n\"Could not copy files.\"\n,\n\n            \n\"Ensure that passwordless SSH works for \n{}\n.\"\n.\nformat\n(\nstaged_source\n.\nparameters\n.\nsource_address\n),\n\n            \nresult\n.\nstderr\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we check to see if our Bash command actually worked okay. If not, we raise an error\nmessage, and describe one possible problem for the user to investigate. For more details on raising user visible errors, see this \nreference\n.\n\n\nSaving Snapshot Data\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhenever the Delphix Engine takes a \nsnapshot\n of a dSource or VDB,\nthe plugin has the chance to save any information it likes alongside that snapshot. Later, if the\nsnapshot is ever used to provision a new VDB, the plugin can use the previously-saved information\nto help get the new VDB ready for use.\n\n\nThe format of this data is controlled by the plugin's \nsnapshotDefinition\n schema. In our case, we\ndon't have any data we need to save. So, there's not much to do here. We will not modify the blank\nschema that was created by \ndvp init\n.\n\n\nWe do still need to provide python function for the engine to call, but we don't have to do much.\nIn fact, the default implementation that was generated by \ndvp init\n will work just fine for our purposes:\n\n\n@plugin\n.\nlinked\n.\npost_snapshot\n()\n\n\ndef\n \nlinked_post_snapshot\n(\nstaged_source\n,\n\n                         \nrepository\n,\n\n                         \nsource_config\n,\n\n                         \noptional_snapshot_parameters\n):\n\n    \nreturn\n \nSnapshotDefinition\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only thing this code is doing is creating a new object using our (empty) snapshot\ndefinition, and returning that new empty object.\n\n\nHow to Link and Sync in the Delphix Engine\n\u00b6\n\n\nLet's try it out and make sure this works!\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should already have a repository and source config set up from the previous page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can optionally set up a new staging environment. Or, you can simply re-use your source\n    environment for staging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nRecall that, for simplicity's sake, this plugin requires that passwordless SSH is set up between\nyour staging and source environments. You may want to verify this before continuing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs before, use \ndvp build\n and \ndvp upload\n to get your latest plugin changes installed onto\nthe Delphix Engine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nManage > Environments\n, select your \nsource\n environment, and then go to the \nDatabases\n tab.

Subsequent syncs may then be periodically performed in order to keep the dSource up-to-date.  The details of how this is done varies significantly from plugin to plugin. For example, some plugins will simply copy files from the filesystem. Other plugins might contact a DBMS and instruct it to send backup or replication streams. There are many possibilities here, but they all break down into two main strategies that the plugin author can choose from: direct and staging.  With the  direct  strategy, the plugin is not in charge\nof the data copying. Instead the Delphix Engine directly pulls raw data from the source environment.\nThe plugin merely provides the location of the data. This is a very simple strategy, and is also\nquite limiting.  For our first plugin, we will be using the more flexible  staging  strategy. With this strategy, the Delphix Engine uses NFS for Unix environments (or iSCSI on Windows environments) to mount storage onto a  staging environment . Our plugin will then be in full control of how to get data from the source environment onto this storage mount.  With the staging strategy, there are two types of syncs: sync and resync. A  sync  is used to ingest incremental changes while a  resync  is used to re-ingest all the data for the dSource. For databases, this could mean re-ingesting from a full database backup to reset the dSource. A  sync  and a  resync  will execute the same plugin operations. To differentiate a  sync  from a  resync , simply add a boolean property (i.e.  resync ) in the plugin's  snapshot parameters definition . Once  sync  or  resync  is selected, the property will be passed into  linked.pre_snapshot  and  linked.post_snapshot  as a  snapshot parameter .  A regular  sync  is the default and is executed as part of policy driven syncs. A  resync  is only executed during initial ingestion or if the Delphix user manually starts one. The customer can manually trigger a  resync  via the UI by selecting the dSource, going to more options and selecting  Resynchronize dSource .    Gotcha  Although it is not common, it is entirely possible that the staging environment is the same as the source environment. Be careful not to assume otherwise in your plugins.",

Info  This plugin is assuming that  rsync  is installed on the staging host, and that the staging\nhost user is able to SSH into the source host without having to type in a password. A more\nfull-featured plugin would test these assumptions, usually as part of discovery.

Open up the  plugin_runner.py  file and find the  linked_mount_specification  function (which was generated by  dvp init ).

This is what allows the Delphix\nEngine to know which function to call when it's time to learn where to mount.

So, in our case, that means\nit will contain attributes called  source_address ,  username , and  mount_location .

Here, we\ncreate a mount object that says to mount onto the staging environment, at the location specified\nby the user.      return MountSpecification([mount])  On the line just before this one, we created an object that describes a  single  mount.

Unlike the previous operations we've seen so far, the pre-snapshot operation will not be autogenerated by  dvp init .\nSo, we will need to add one ourselves.  Open up the  plugin_runner.py  file.

For example  jdoe@sourcehost.mycompany.com:/bin . As\nbefore with  mountLocation , we have defined our schemas such that these three pieces of information\nwere provided by the user.

            "text": "Provisioning\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhat is Provisioning?\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce Delphix has a \nsnapshot\n of a dataset (for example of a dSource), it is possible to quickly clone that snapshot to create a new \nvirtual dataset\n. This new virtual dataset will be made available for use on a \ntarget environment\n. This process is called \nprovisioning\n.\n\n\nOur Provisioning Strategy\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor many plugins, there is a lot of work that needs to be done before a newly-provisioned virtual dataset can be made useful. For example, it might need to be registered with a running DBMS. Or, maybe some data inside the dataset needs to be changed so it behaves properly on the target environment.\n\n\nIn our case, however, there is very little to do. All we really require is that the files in the virtual dataset are accessible at some path on the target environment. Since the Delphix Engine takes care of mounting the data, we only need to worry about controlling \nwhere\n that data is mounted.\n\n\nDefining our Provision-Related Data Formats\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe have already seen four custom data formats: for repositories, source configs, snapshots and\nlinked sources. The final one is used for \nvirtual sources\n.\n\n\nRecall that, for our plugin, a VDB is just a directory full of files. There is no special\nprocedure needed to enable it, no DBMS to coordinate with, etc. All we need to do is make the files\navailable on the target environment.\n\n\nSo, the only question for the user is \"Where should these files live?\"\n\n\nOpen up \nschema.json\n, locate the \nvirtualSourceDefintion\n section, and change it to look like this:\n\n\n\"virtualSourceDefinition\"\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"object\"\n,\n\n    \n\"additionalProperties\"\n \n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n    \n\"required\"\n:\n \n[\n\"mountLocation\"\n],\n\n    \n\"properties\"\n \n:\n \n{\n\n        \n\"mountLocation\"\n:\n \n{\n\n            \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n,\n\n            \n\"format\"\n:\n \n\"unixpath\"\n,\n\n            \n\"prettyName\"\n:\n \n\"Mount Location on Target Host\"\n,\n\n            \n\"description\"\n:\n \n\"Where to mount VDB onto the target host\"\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis should look familiar from the source config schema that we did earlier. We only have one\nproperty, and it represents the mount location on the target environment.\n\n\nImplementing Provisioning\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere are numerous ways for a plugin to customize the provisioning process.\nFor our example plugin, we just need to do a few things:\n\n\n\n\nTell Delphix where to mount the virtual dataset.\n\n\nCreate a \nsourceConfig\n to represent each newly-provisioned virtual dataset.\n\n\nModify an existing \nsourceConfig\n, if necessary, when the virtual dataset is refreshed or rewound.\n\n\nConstruct snapshot-related data any time a snapshot is taken of the virtual dataset.\n\n\n\n\nControlling Mounting\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs we saw previously with linked sources, we need to tell Delphix where to mount the dataset. Open\nup \nplugin_runner.py\n and find the \nplugin.virtual.mount_specification\n decorator. Change that function so that\nit looks like this:\n\n\n@plugin\n.\nvirtual\n.\nmount_specification\n()\n\n\ndef\n \nvdb_mount_spec\n(\nvirtual_source\n,\n \nrepository\n):\n\n    \nmount_location\n \n=\n \nvirtual_source\n.\nparameters\n.\nmount_location\n\n    \nmount\n \n=\n \nMount\n(\nvirtual_source\n.\nconnection\n.\nenvironment\n,\n \nmount_location\n)\n\n    \nreturn\n \nMountSpecification\n([\nmount\n])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we did with linked sources, we just look up what the user told us, and then package that up\nand return it to Delphix.\n\n\nCreating a Source Config for a new VDB\n\u00b6\n\n\nJust like we saw earlier with \nlinked datasets\n, each virtual dataset will need its own source config so that the Delphix Engine can interact with it. Our plugin is in charge of creating that source config at provision time\n\n\nAs a reminder, here is what our schema looks like for source configs:\n\n\n\"sourceConfigDefinition\"\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"object\"\n,\n\n    \n\"required\"\n:\n \n[\n\"name\"\n,\n \n\"path\"\n],\n\n    \n\"additionalProperties\"\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n    \n\"properties\"\n:\n \n{\n\n        \n\"name\"\n:\n \n{\n\n          \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n,\n\n          \n\"prettyName\"\n:\n \n\"Dataset Name\"\n,\n\n          \n\"description\"\n:\n \n\"User-visible name for this dataset\"\n\n        \n},\n\n        \n\"path\"\n:\n \n{\n\n          \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n,\n\n          \n\"format\"\n:\n \n\"unixpath\"\n,\n\n          \n\"prettyName\"\n:\n \n\"Path\"\n,\n\n          \n\"description\"\n:\n \n\"Full path to data location on the remote environment\"\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n\"nameField\"\n:\n \n\"name\"\n,\n\n    \n\"identityFields\"\n:\n \n[\n\"path\"\n]\n\n\n}\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, for each newly-cloned virtual dataset, we create a new source config object with a name and a\npath. This is done by the \nconfigure\n plugin operation.\n\n\nIn addition to generating a new source config, the configure operation is also tasked with getting\nthe newly-cloned dataset ready for use on the target environment. What this means exactly will vary\nfrom plugin to plugin. For our simple plugin, the dataset does not require any setup work, and so we\nonly have to worry about the source config.\n\n\nFind the \nplugin.virtual.configure\n decorator and change the function to look like this:\n\n\n@plugin\n.\nvirtual\n.\nconfigure\n()\n\n\ndef\n \nconfigure_new_vdb\n(\nvirtual_source\n,\n \nsnapshot\n,\n \nrepository\n):\n\n    \nmount_location\n \n=\n \nvirtual_source\n.\nparameters\n.\nmount_location\n\n    \nname\n \n=\n \n\"VDB mounted at \n{}\n\"\n.\nformat\n(\nmount_location\n)\n\n    \nreturn\n \nSourceConfigDefinition\n(\npath\n=\nmount_location\n,\n \nname\n=\nname\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModifying a Source Config after Rewind or Refresh\n\u00b6\n\n\nJust as a new VDB might need to be configured, a refreshed or rewound VDB might need to be\n\"reconfigured\" to handle the new post-refresh (or post-rewind) state of the VDB. So, just as there\nis a \nconfigure\n operation, there is also a \nreconfigure\n operation.\n\n\nThe main difference between the two is that \nconfigure\n must \ncreate\n a source config, but\n\nreconfigure\n needs to \nmodify\n a pre-existing source config.\n\n\nIn our simple plugin, there is no special work to do at reconfigure time, and there is no reason\nto modify anything about the source config. We just need to write a \nreconfigure\n operation that\nreturns the existing source config without making any changes. Find the \nplugin.virtual.reconfigure\n decorator and modify the function as follows.\n\n\n@plugin\n.\nvirtual\n.\nreconfigure\n()\n\n\ndef\n \nreconfigure_existing_vdb\n(\nvirtual_source\n,\n \nrepository\n,\n \nsource_config\n,\n \nsnapshot\n):\n\n    \nreturn\n \nsource_config\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving Snapshot Data\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs with our linked sources, we don't actually have anything we need to save when VDB snapshots are\ntaken.

You should see at least one snapshot, and maybe more than one if you have manually taken a snapshot, or if you have a snapshot policy in place.

Complete the steps and select \nSubmit\n.\n  During VDB provisioning one of the things you will have to do is to provide the data required by your virtual source schema. In our case, that means you will be asked to provide a value for \nmountLocation\n. You will also be asked to choose a target environment on which the new VDB will live. After the wizard finishes, you will see a job appear in the \nActions\n tab on the right-hand side of the screen.

The Delphix Engine does not use this field, and therefore imposes no restrictions on its content. This is a free-form string which the plugin can use in any way it feels like.\n\n\nExamples might be \"5.3.0\", \"2012B\", \"MyPlugin Millennium Edition, Service Pack 3\", \"Playful Platypus\" or \"Salton City\".\n\n\nThe external version is specified using the \nexternalVersion\n property in your \nplugin config\n file.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nUse an external version that makes it easier for end users to determine newer vs older plugins.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Number\n\u00b6\n\n\nUnlike \"external version\", this field is intended to convey information to the Delphix Engine. This is a string of integers, separated by periods. Examples would be \"5.3.0\", \"7\", \"5.3.0.0.0.157\".\n\n\nThe Delphix Engine uses the build number to guard against end users trying to \"downgrade\" their plugin to an older, incompatible version. So, if a user has build number \"3.4.1\" installed, then they may not install a version with a build number like \"2.x.y\", \"3.3.y\" or \"3.4.0\".\n\n\nThe build number is specified using the \nbuildNumber\n property in your \nplugin config\n file.\n\n\nThis field is required to be a string. You might need to enclose your build number in quotes in order to prevent YAML from interpreting the field as a number.

So, \"1.0.0\" is treated the same as \"1\".\n\n\nBuild numbers are sortable numerically, with earlier numbers having more significance than later numbers. So, \"2.0\" comes after \"1.99999\", and \"1.10\" comes after \"1.2\".\n\n\nThe Delphix Engine will never allow installation of plugin with a build number that is ordered before the the already-installed build number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nYou can upload a plugin with the same \nbuildNumber\n as the installed plugin. However this should only be done while a plugin is being developed. Plugin releases for end users should never have the same \nbuildNumber\n\n\n\n\nPlease also see the \nApp-Style vs. Enterprise-Style section\n below. We generally recommend using a single integer build number for app-style development. Build numbers need to have multiple parts if you are doing enterprise-style development.\n\n\nRelease Strategies\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere are two main strategies for releasing software:\n\n\n\"App-style\" Release Strategy\n\u00b6\n\n\nHere, all users are expected to use the latest available version of the software. Most consumer software works this way today -- websites, phone apps, etc. An app-style strategy is much simpler, but also more limiting:\n\n\n\n\nAt any time, there is only one branch under active development.\n\n\nCustomers that want bugfixes must upgrade to the latest version.\n\n\nThe plugin's build number can be a simple integer that is incremented with each new release.\n\n\n\n\n\"Enterprise-style\" Release Strategy\n\u00b6\n\n\nHere, you might distinguish \"major\" releases of your software from \"minor\" releases. You might expect some customers to continue to use older major releases for a long time, even after a new major release comes out. This strategy is often used for software like operating systems and DBMSs, where upgrading can cause significant disruption. An enterprise-style strategy is more flexible, but also more cumbersome:\n\n\n\n\nThere may be multiple branches under active development at any time. Typically one branch for every \"major release\" that is still being supported. This requires careful coordination to make sure that each new code change ends up on the correct branch (or branches).\n\n\nIt is possible to supply bugfix-only minor releases (often called \"patch releases\") which build atop older major releases. Customers do not need to move to the new major version in order to get these bugfixes.\n\n\nThe plugin's build number needs to be composed of multiple integers.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using this strategy read more \nhere\n about how to deal with backports and hotfixes.\n\n\nYou may use whichever of these strategies works best for you. The SDK and the Delphix Engine support either strategy. You can even change your mind later and switch to the other strategy.\n\n\nRecommendations\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nBuild your plugin with the newest Virtualization SDK version available.\n\n\nOnly publish one artifact built for a given official version of the plugin.\n\n\nThe official release of a plugin should not use the same build number as a development build.\n\n\nUse an \nexternal version\n that helps easily identify newer plugins.\n\n\nPublish a plugin version compatibility matrix which lists out the plugin version, the Virtualization SDK it was built with and the Delphix Engine version(s) it supports.",

End users can continue to access data from existing VDBs during a plugin upgrade. However, while a particular plugin is in the process of being upgraded, no administrative Delphix Engine operations like: VDB Refresh, VDB Provision, dSource Disable/Enable etc will be allowed on the objects associated with that plugin. Objects associated with other plugins will not be affected.\n\n\n\n\nData Migrations\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhat is a Data Migration?\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhenever a new version of a plugin is installed on a Delphix Engine, the engine needs to migrate pre-existing data from its old format (as specified by the schemas in the old version of the plugin), to its new format (as specified by the schemas in the new version of the plugin).\n\n\nA \ndata migration\n is a function that is responsible for doing this conversion. It is provided by the plugin.\n\n\nThus, when the new plugin version is installed, the engine will call all applicable data migrations provided by the new plugin. This ensures that all data is always in the format expected by the new plugin.\n\n\nA Simple Example\n\u00b6\n\n\nLet's go back to the above example of the plugin that adds a new boolean option to allow users to avoid syncing backup and hidden files. Here is a data migration that the new plugin can provide to handle the data format change:\n\n\n@plugin\n.\nupgrade\n.\nlinked_source\n(\n\"2019.11.20\"\n)\n\n\ndef\n \nadd_skip_option\n(\nold_linked_source\n):\n\n    \nreturn\n \n{\n\n      \n\"skipHiddenAndBackup\"\n:\n \nfalse\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exact rules for data migrations are covered in detail \nbelow\n. Here, we'll just walk through this code line by line and make some observations.\n\n\n@plugin\n.\nupgrade\n.\nlinked_source\n(\n\"2019.11.20\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above line is a \ndecorator\n that identifies the following function as a data migration. This particular migration will handle linked sources. It is given an ID of \n2019.11.20\n -- this controls when this migration is run in relation to other data migrations.\n\n\ndef\n \nadd_skip_option\n(\nold_linked_source\n):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the data migration takes an argument representing the old-format data. In this simple example, we know that there are no properties in the old-format data, so we can just ignore it.\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \n{\n\n      \n\"skipHiddenAndBackup\"\n:\n \nfalse\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we are returning a Python dictionary representing the new format of the data. In this example, the dictionary has only one field: \nskipHiddenAndBackup\n. Because the old version of the plugin had no ability to skip files, we default this property to \nfalse\n to match the new schema.\n\n\nRules for Data Migrations\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs shown above, the a data migration receives old-format input and produces new-format output. The rules and recommendations for data migrations follow:\n\n\nRules\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput and output are Python dictionaries, with properties named exactly as specified in the schemas. Note that this differs from other plugin operations, where the inputs are defined with autogenerated Python \nclasses\n, and whose properties use Python-style naming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach data migration must be tagged with an ID string. This string must consist of one or more positive integers separated by periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData migration IDs must be numerically unique. Note that \n\"1.2\"\n, \n\"01.02\"\n, and \"\n1.2.0.0.0\"\n are all considered to be identical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce released, a data migration must never be deleted. An attempted upgrade will fail if the already-installed plugin version has a data migration that does not appear in the to-be-installed version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt upgrade time, the engine will find the set of new migrations provided by the new version that are not already part of the already-installed version. Each of these migrations will then be run, in the order specified below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter running all applicable migrations, the engine will confirm that the resultant data conforms to the new version's schemas. If not, the upgrade will fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that there is no requirement or guarantee that the input or output of any particular data migration will conform to a schema. We only guarantee that the input to the \nfirst\n data migration conforms to the schema of the already-installed plugin version. And, we only require that the output of the \nfinal\n data migration conforms to the schema of the new plugin version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData migrations are run in the order specified by their IDs. The ordering is numerical, not lexicographical. Thus \n\"1\"\n would run before \n\"2\"\n, which would run before \n\"10\"\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData migrations have no access to \nPlatform Libraries\n or remote hosts. For example: If a data migration attempts to use \nrun_bash\n the upgrade will fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the above rules imply that at least one data migration is required any time a schema change is made that would invalidate any data produced using a previous version of the plugin. For example: adding a \n\"required\"\n property to the new schema.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend using a \"Year.Month.Date\" format like \n\"2019.11.04\"\n for migration IDs. You can use trailing integers as necessary (e.g. use \n\"2019.11.04.5\"\n if you need something to be run between \n\"2019.11.04\"\n and \n\"2019.11.05\"\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though they follow similar naming rules, migration IDs are not the same thing as plugin versions. We do not recommend using your plugin version in your migration IDs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend using small, single-purpose data migrations. That is, if you end up making four schema changes over the course of developing a new plugin version, we recommend writing four different data migrations, one for each change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Migration Example\n\u00b6\n\n\nHere is a very simple data migration.\n\n\n@plugin\n.\nupgrade\n.\nrepository\n(\n\"2019.12.15\"\n)\n\n\ndef\n \nadd_new_flag_to_repo\n(\nold_repository\n):\n\n  \nnew_repository\n \n=\n \ndict\n(\nold_repository\n)\n\n  \nnew_repository\n[\n\"useNewFeature\"\n]\n \n=\n \nFalse\n\n  \nreturn\n \nnew_repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebugging Data Migration Problems\n\u00b6\n\n\nDuring the process of upgrading to a new version, the Delphix Engine will run all applicable data migrations, and then ensure that the resulting object matches the new schema. But, what if there is a bug, and the resulting object does \nnot\n match the schema?\n\n\nSecurity Concerns Prevent Detailed Error Messages\n\u00b6\n\n\nOne problem here is that the Delphix Engine is limited in the information that it can provide in the error message. Ideally, the engine would say exactly what was wrong with the object (e.g.: \"The field \nport\n has the value \n15\n, but the schema says it has to have a value between \n256\n and \n1024\n\").\n\n\nBut, the Delphix Engine cannot do this for security reasons. Ordinarily, the Delphix Engine knows which fields contain sensitive information, and can redact such fields from error messages. But, the only reason the Delphix Engine has that knowledge is because the schema provides that information. If an object does \nnot\n conform to the schema, then the Delphix Engine can't know what is sensitive and what isn't.\n\n\nTherefore, the error message here might lack the detail necessary to debug the problem.\n\n\nOne Solution: Temporary Logging\n\u00b6\n\n\nDuring development of a new plugin version, you may find yourself trying to find and fix such a bug.\nOne technique is to use temporary logging.\n\n\nFor example, while you are trying to locate and fix the bug, you could put a log statement at the very end of each of your data migrations, like so:\n\n\n  logger.debug(\"Migration 2010.03.01 returning {}\".format(new_object))\n  return new_object\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the \nLogging\n section for more information about logging works.\n\n\nFrom the logs, you'll be able to see exactly what each migration is returning. From there, hopefully the problem will become apparent. As a supplemental tool, consider pasting these results (along with your schema) into an online JSON validator for more information.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIt is \nvery important\n that you only use logging as a temporary debugging strategy. \nSuch logging must be removed before you release the plugin to end users\n. If this logging ends up in your end product, it could cause a serious security concern. Please see our \nsensitive data best practices\n for more information.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Data Migrations Are Insufficient\n\u00b6\n\n\nNew versions of plugins often require some modification of data that was written using an older version of the same plugin. Data migrations handle this modification. Unfortunately, data migrations cannot always fully handle all possible upgrade scenarios by themselves.\n\n\nFor example, a new plugin version might want to add a new required field to one of its schemas. But, the correct value for this new field might not be knowable while the upgrade is underway -- perhaps it must be entered by the user, or perhaps it would require automatic discovery to be rerun.\n\n\nSuch a situation will require some user intervention after the upgrade.\n\n\nIn all cases, of course you will want to \nclearly document\n to your users that there will extra work required so they can make sure they known what they are getting into before they decide to upgrade.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIt should also be said that you should try to avoid cases like this.  As much as possible, try to make your post-upgrade plugin function with no user intervention. Only resort to user intervention as a last resort.\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended strategy here is to arrange for the affected objects to be in an \"invalid\" state, and for your plugin code to detect this state, and throw errors when the objects are used.\n\n\nFor such a situation, we recommend the following process:\n\n\n\n\nMake your schema changes so that the affected property can be set in such a way that plugin code can identify it as being invalid. Typically this is done by allowing for some \"sentinel\" value. This may require you to have a less-strict schema definition than you might otherwise want.\n\n\nIn your data migrations, make sure the affected properties are indeed marked invalid.\n\n\nIn any plugin code that needs to use these properties, first check them for validity. If they are invalid, then raise an error that explains the situation to the user, and tells them what steps they need to take.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing are two examples of schema changes that need extra user intervention after upgrade. One will require a rediscovery, and the other will require the user to enter information.\n\n\nAutodiscovery Example\n\u00b6\n\n\nSuppose that a new plugin version adds a new required field to its repository schema. This new field specifies a full path to a database installation. The following listing shows what we'd ideally like the new repository schema to look like (\ninstallationPath\n is the new required property)\n\n\n\"repositoryDefinition\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n        \"installationPath\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"unixpath\"}\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"name\", \"installationPath\"],\n    \"nameField\": \"name\",\n    \"identityFields\": [\"name\"]\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new plugin's autodiscovery code will know how to find this full path. Therefore, any repositories that are discovered (or rediscovered) after the upgrade will have this path filled in correctly.\n\n\nBut, there may be repositories that were discovered before the upgrade. The data migrations will have to ensure that \nsome\n value is provided for this new field. However, a data migration will not be able to determine what the correct final value is.\n\n\nOne way to handle this is to modify the schema to allow a special value to indicate that the object needs to be rediscovered. In this example, we'll change the schema from the ideal version above, removing the \nunixpath\n constraint on this string:\n\n\n\"installationPath\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, our data migration can set this property to some special sentinel value that will never be mistaken for an actual installation path.\n\n\n_REDISCOVERY_TOKEN = \"###_REPOSITORY_NEEDS_REDISCOVERY_###\"\n\n@plugin.upgrade.repository(\"2020.02.04.01\")\ndef repo_path(old_repository):\n    # We need to add in a repository path, but there is no way for us to know\n    # what the correct path is here, so we cannot set this to anything useful.\n    # Instead, we'll set a special sentinel value that will indicate that the\n    # repository is unusable until the remote host is rediscovered.\n    old_repository[\"installationPath\"] = _REDISCOVERY_TOKEN\n    return old_repository\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, wherever the plugin needs to use this path, we'll need to check for this sentinel value, and error out if we find it.  For example, we might need a valid path during the \nconfigure\n operation:\n\n\n@plugin.virtual.configure()\ndef configure(virtual_source, snapshot, repository):\n    if repository.installation_path == _REDISCOVERY_TOKEN:\n        # We cannot use this repository as/is -- it must be rediscovered.\n        msg = 'Unable to use repository \"{}\" because it has not been updated ' \\\n        'since upgrade. Please re-run discovery and try again'\n        raise UserError(msg.format(repository.name))\n\n    # ... actual configure code goes here\n\n\n\n\n\nManual Entry\n\u00b6\n\n\nAbove, we looked at an example where the plugin could handle filling in new values for a new field at discovery time, so the user was simply asked to rediscover.\n\n\nSometimes, though, users themselves will have to be the ones to supply new values.\n\n\nSuppose that a new plugin version wants to add a required field to the \nvirtualSource\n object. This new property will tell which port the database should be accessible on. Ideally, we might want our new field to look like this:\n\n\n\"port\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 1024, \"maximum\": 65535}\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, however, the data migration will not know which value is correct here. This is something the user must decide. Still, the data migration must provide \nsome\n value. As before, we'll change the schema a bit from what would be ideal:\n\n\n\"port\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 0, \"maximum\": 65535}\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, our data migration can use the value \n0\n as code for \"this VDB needs user intervention\".\n\n\n@plugin.upgrade.virtual_source(\"2020.02.04.02\")\ndef add_dummy_port(old_virtual_source):\n    # Set the \"port\" property to 0 to act as a placeholder.\n    old_virtual_source[\"port\"] = 0\n    return old_virtual_source\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with the previous example, our plugin code will need to look for this special value, and raise an error so that the user knows what to do. This example shows the \nVirtual Source Reconfigure\n operation, but of course, similar code will be needed anywhere else that the new \nport\n property is required.\n\n\n@plugin.virtual.reconfigure()\ndef virtual_reconfigure(virtual_source, repository, source_config, snapshot):\n    if virtual_source.parameters.port == 0:\n        raise UserError('VDB \"{}\" cannot function properly. Please choose a ' \\\n        'port number for this VDB to use.'.format(virtual_source.parameters.name))\n\n    # ... actual reconfigure code goes here",

Note that this differs from other plugin operations, where the inputs are defined with autogenerated Python  classes , and whose properties use Python-style naming.    Each data migration must be tagged with an ID string. This string must consist of one or more positive integers separated by periods.    Data migration IDs must be numerically unique. Note that  \"1.2\" ,  \"01.02\" , and \" 1.2.0.0.0\"  are all considered to be identical.    Once released, a data migration must never be deleted. An attempted upgrade will fail if the already-installed plugin version has a data migration that does not appear in the to-be-installed version.    At upgrade time, the engine will find the set of new migrations provided by the new version that are not already part of the already-installed version. Each of these migrations will then be run, in the order specified below.    After running all applicable migrations, the engine will confirm that the resultant data conforms to the new version's schemas. If not, the upgrade will fail.    Note that there is no requirement or guarantee that the input or output of any particular data migration will conform to a schema. We only guarantee that the input to the  first  data migration conforms to the schema of the already-installed plugin version. And, we only require that the output of the  final  data migration conforms to the schema of the new plugin version.    Data migrations are run in the order specified by their IDs. The ordering is numerical, not lexicographical. Thus  \"1\"  would run before  \"2\" , which would run before  \"10\" .    Data migrations have no access to  Platform Libraries  or remote hosts. For example: If a data migration attempts to use  run_bash  the upgrade will fail.    Note that the above rules imply that at least one data migration is required any time a schema change is made that would invalidate any data produced using a previous version of the plugin.

            "text": "New versions of plugins often require some modification of data that was written using an older version of the same plugin. Data migrations handle this modification. Unfortunately, data migrations cannot always fully handle all possible upgrade scenarios by themselves.  For example, a new plugin version might want to add a new required field to one of its schemas. But, the correct value for this new field might not be knowable while the upgrade is underway -- perhaps it must be entered by the user, or perhaps it would require automatic discovery to be rerun.  Such a situation will require some user intervention after the upgrade.  In all cases, of course you will want to  clearly document  to your users that there will extra work required so they can make sure they known what they are getting into before they decide to upgrade.   Tip  It should also be said that you should try to avoid cases like this.  As much as possible, try to make your post-upgrade plugin function with no user intervention. Only resort to user intervention as a last resort.   The recommended strategy here is to arrange for the affected objects to be in an \"invalid\" state, and for your plugin code to detect this state, and throw errors when the objects are used.  For such a situation, we recommend the following process:   Make your schema changes so that the affected property can be set in such a way that plugin code can identify it as being invalid. Typically this is done by allowing for some \"sentinel\" value. This may require you to have a less-strict schema definition than you might otherwise want.  In your data migrations, make sure the affected properties are indeed marked invalid.  In any plugin code that needs to use these properties, first check them for validity. If they are invalid, then raise an error that explains the situation to the user, and tells them what steps they need to take.   Following are two examples of schema changes that need extra user intervention after upgrade. One will require a rediscovery, and the other will require the user to enter information.",

Therefore, any repositories that are discovered (or rediscovered) after the upgrade will have this path filled in correctly.  But, there may be repositories that were discovered before the upgrade. The data migrations will have to ensure that  some  value is provided for this new field. However, a data migration will not be able to determine what the correct final value is.  One way to handle this is to modify the schema to allow a special value to indicate that the object needs to be rediscovered. In this example, we'll change the schema from the ideal version above, removing the  unixpath  constraint on this string:  \"installationPath\": { \"type\": \"string\" }  Now, our data migration can set this property to some special sentinel value that will never be mistaken for an actual installation path.  _REDISCOVERY_TOKEN = \"###_REPOSITORY_NEEDS_REDISCOVERY_###\"\n\n@plugin.upgrade.repository(\"2020.02.04.01\")\ndef repo_path(old_repository):\n    # We need to add in a repository path, but there is no way for us to know\n    # what the correct path is here, so we cannot set this to anything useful.\n    # Instead, we'll set a special sentinel value that will indicate that the\n    # repository is unusable until the remote host is rediscovered.\n    old_repository[\"installationPath\"] = _REDISCOVERY_TOKEN\n    return old_repository  Now, wherever the plugin needs to use this path, we'll need to check for this sentinel value, and error out if we find it.  For example, we might need a valid path during the  configure  operation:  @plugin.virtual.configure()\ndef configure(virtual_source, snapshot, repository):\n    if repository.installation_path == _REDISCOVERY_TOKEN:\n        # We cannot use this repository as/is -- it must be rediscovered.\n        msg = 'Unable to use repository \"{}\" because it has not been updated ' \\\n        'since upgrade.

This new property will tell which port the database should be accessible on. Ideally, we might want our new field to look like this:  \"port\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 1024, \"maximum\": 65535}  Again, however, the data migration will not know which value is correct here. This is something the user must decide. Still, the data migration must provide  some  value. As before, we'll change the schema a bit from what would be ideal:  \"port\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 0, \"maximum\": 65535}  Now, our data migration can use the value  0  as code for \"this VDB needs user intervention\".  @plugin.upgrade.virtual_source(\"2020.02.04.02\")\ndef add_dummy_port(old_virtual_source):\n    # Set the \"port\" property to 0 to act as a placeholder.\n    old_virtual_source[\"port\"] = 0\n    return old_virtual_source  As with the previous example, our plugin code will need to look for this special value, and raise an error so that the user knows what to do.

There are three main things to understand about them, which are explained just below:\n\n\n\n\nWhat is JSON?\n\n\nWhat is a JSON schema?\n\n\nHow has Delphix augmented JSON schemas?\n\n\n\n\nJSON\n\u00b6\n\n\nJSON stands for \"Javascript Object Notation\". JSON is a data-interchange format that is intended to be precise and also somewhat human-readable. Here are some simple examples of data in JSON format:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"hello\"\n\n\nA string. Note the double quotes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nAn integer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrue\n\n\nA boolean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\"name\": \"Julie\", \"age\": 37}\n\n\nA JSON object with two fields, \nname\n (a string), and \nage\n (an integer). Objects are denoted with curly braces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ true, false, true]\n\n\nA JSON array with three booleans. Arrays are denoted with square brackets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more details on JSON, please see \nhttps://www.json.org/\n.\n\n\nJSON Schemas\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe \"JSON schema\" format is built on top of JSON. This adds some special rules and keywords that are intended to facilitate the \ndescription\n of the format of data (whereas \"raw\" JSON is intended for storing data).\n\n\nHere is an example of a JSON schema that defines a (simplified) US address:\n\n\n{\n\n    \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"object\"\n,\n\n    \n\"required\"\n:\n \n[\n\"name\"\n,\n \n\"streetNumber\"\n,\n \n\"street\"\n,\n \n\"city\"\n,\n \n\"state\"\n,\n \n\"zip5\"\n],\n\n    \n\"additionalProperties\"\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n    \n\"properties\"\n:\n \n{\n\n        \n\"name\"\n:\n \n{\n \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n \n},\n\n        \n\"streetNumber\"\n:\n \n{\n \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n \n},\n\n        \n\"street\"\n:\n \n{\n \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n \n},\n\n        \n\"unit\"\n:\n \n{\n \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n \n},\n\n        \n\"city\"\n:\n \n{\n \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n,\n \n\"pattern\"\n:\n \n\"^[A-Z][A-Za-z ]*$\"\n \n},\n\n        \n\"state\"\n:\n \n{\n \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n,\n \n\"pattern\"\n:\n \n\"^[A-Z]{2}$\"\n \n},\n\n        \n\"zip5\"\n:\n \n{\n \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n,\n \n\"pattern\"\n:\n \n\"^[0-9]{5}\"\n},\n\n        \n\"zipPlus4\"\n:\n \n{\n \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n,\n \n\"pattern\"\n:\n \n\"^[0-9]{4}\"\n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this is perfectly valid JSON data. It's a JSON object with four fields: \ntype\n (a JSON string), \nrequired\n (A JSON array), \nadditionalProperties\n (a JSON boolean), and \nproperties\n. \nproperties\n, in turn is a JSON object with with 8 fields, each of which is a JSON object, with its own properties, etc.\n\n\nBut, this isn't \njust\n a JSON object. This is a JSON schema. It uses special keywords like \ntype\n \nrequired\n, and \nadditionalProperties\n. These have specially-defined meanings in the context of JSON schemas.\n\n\nHere is a list of the special keywords used by the above schema. Note that this is only a small subset of JSON schema keywords.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkeyword\n\n\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadditionalProperties\n\n\nDetermines whether the schema allows properties that are not explicitly listed in the \nproperties\n specification. Must be a \ntrue\n or \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npattern\n\n\nUsed with string types to specify a regular expression that the property must conform to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequired\n\n\nA list of required properties. Properties not listed in this list are optional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstring\n\n\nUsed with \ntype\n to declare that a property must be a string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\nSpecifies a datatype. Common values are \nobject\n, \narray\n, \nnumber\n, \ninteger\n, \nboolean\n, and \nstring\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome points to note about the address schema above:\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the \nrequired\n list, all valid addresses must have fields called \nname\n, \nstreetNumber\n and so on.\n\n\nunit\n and \nzipPlus4\n do not appear in the \nrequired\n list, and therefore are optional.\n\n\nBecause of \nadditionalProperties\n being \nfalse\n, valid addresses cannot make up their own fields like \nnickname\n or \ndoorbellLocation\n.\n\n\nBecause of the \npattern\n, any \nstate\n field in a valid address must consist of exactly two capital letters.\n\n\nSimilarly, \ncity\n must only contain letters and spaces, and \nzip\n and \nzipPlus4\n must only contain digits.\n\n\nEach property has its own valid subschema that describes its own type definition.\n\n\n\n\nHere is a JSON object that conforms to the above schema:\n\n\n{\n\n  \n\"name\"\n:\n \n\"Delphix\"\n,\n\n  \n\"streetNumber\"\n:\n \n\"220\"\n,\n\n  \n\"street\"\n:\n \n\"Congress St.\"\n,\n\n  \n\"unit\"\n:\n \n\"200\"\n,\n\n  \n\"city\"\n:\n \n\"Boston\"\n,\n\n  \n\"state\"\n:\n \n\"MA\"\n,\n\n  \n\"zip\"\n:\n \n\"02210\"\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nA common point of confusion is the distinction between a JSON schema and a JSON object that conforms to a schema. Remember, a schema describes the form of data. In our example, the schema \ndescribes\n what an address looks like. The address itself is not a schema.\n\n\n\n\nFor much more detail on JSON schemas, including which keywords are available, what they mean, and where you can use them, see \nhttps://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/\n.\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nBe careful when using the JSON schema keyword \ndefault\n. This keyword is commonly misunderstood. Specifically, it does not mean \"If the user does not provide a value, then this default value will be auto-substituted instead\", as you might expect. In fact, in JSON schemas, \ndefault\n has no semantic meaning at all! Currently, the only thing the Delphix Engine will use this for is to pre-fill widgets on the UI.\n\n\n\n\nDelphix-specific Extensions to JSON Schema\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe JSON schema vocabulary is designed to be extensible for special uses, and Delphix has taken advantage of this to add some new Delphix-specific keywords.\n\n\nThe list below outlines each of these keywords, and provides minimal examples of how they might be used.\n\n\ndescription\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired or Optional?\n\n\nOptional\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere?\n\n\nIn any property subschema, at the same level as \ntype\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \ndescription\n keyword can optionally appear on any property. If it does appear, it is used by the UI as explanatory text for the UI widget associated with the property. If it does not appear, then no explanatory text is shown.\n\n\nIn this example, the UI would show \"User-readable name for the provisioned database\" in small text under the widget.\n\n\n{\n\n  \n\"properties\"\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n\"name\"\n:\n \n{\n\n      \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n,\n\n      \n\"description\"\n:\n \n\"User-readable name for the provisioned database\"\n\n    \n}\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nidentityFields\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired or Optional?\n\n\nRequired (for repository and source config schemas only)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere?\n\n\nAt the top level of a repository or source config schema, at the same level as \ntype\n and \nproperties\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nidentityFields\n is a list of property names that, together, serve as a unique identifier for a repository or source config.\n\n\nWhen a plugin's \nautomatic discovery\n code is called, it will return a list of repositories (or source configs). The Delphix Engine needs to be able to compare this new list with whatever repositories it already knows about.\n\n\nFor example, suppose the engine already knows about a single repository with data \n{\"dbname\": \"my_databsae\", \"path\": \"/var/db/db01\"}\n (note the misspelling!). And, then suppose that automatic discovery is re-run and it returns repository data \n{ \"dbname\": \"my_database\", \"path\": \"/var/db/db01\"}\n.\n\n\nWhat should the Delphix Engine do? Should it conclude that \"my_databsae\" has been deleted, and there is a completely new repository named \"my_database\"? Or, should it conclude that we still have the same old repository, but with an updated name?\n\n\nidentityFields\n is used to handle this. When the engine compares \"new\" data with \"old\" data, it concludes that they belong to the same repository if \nall\n of the identity fields match. If any of the identity fields do not match, then the \"new\" repository data is judged to represent a different repository than the old data.\n\n\nidentityFields\n is \nrequired\n for \nRepositoryDefinition\n and \nSourceConfigDefinition\n schemas, and may not be used in any other schemas.\n\n\nIn this example, we'll tell the Delphix Engine that \npath\n is the sole unique identifier.\n\n\n{\n\n  \n\"properties\"\n:\n \n{\n\n      \n\"dbname\"\n:\n \n{\n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n},\n\n      \n\"path\"\n:\n \n{\n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n}\n\n  \n},\n\n  \n\"identityFields\"\n:\n \n[\n\"path\"\n]\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnameField\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired or Optional?\n\n\nRequired (for repository and source config schemas only)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere?\n\n\nAt the top level of a repository or source config schema, at the same level as \ntype\n and \nproperties\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nnameField\n keyword specifies a single property that is to be used to name the object in the Delphix Engine. The property must be a string field. This keyword is used at the same level as \nproperties\n. It is \nrequired\n for \nRepositoryDefinition\n and \nSourceConfigDefinition\n schemas, and may not be used in any other schemas.\n\n\nIn this example, we will use the \npath\n property as the user-visible name.\n\n\n{\n\n    \n\"properties\"\n:\n \n{\n\n        \n\"path\"\n:\n \n{\n \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n \n},\n\n        \n\"port\"\n:\n \n{\n \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"integer\"\n \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n\"nameField\"\n:\n \n\"path\"\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, if we have an repository object that looks like\n\n\n{\n\n  \n\"path\"\n:\n \n\"/usr/bin\"\n,\n\n  \n\"port\"\n:\n \n8800\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthen the user will be able to refer to this object as \n/usr/bin\n.\n\n\nordering\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired or Optional?\n\n\nOptional\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere?\n\n\nAt the top level, same level as \ntype\n and \nproperties\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nordering\n keyword can be used to order the fields when the UI is autogenerated.\n\n\n{\n\n    \n\"properties\"\n:\n \n{\n\n        \n\"path\"\n:\n \n{\n \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n \n},\n\n        \n\"port\"\n:\n \n{\n \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"integer\"\n \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n\"ordering\"\n:\n \n[\n\"port\"\n,\n \n\"path\"\n]\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, the \nport\n will be the first field in the autogenerated UI wizard followed by \npath\n.\n\n\npassword\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired or Optional?\n\n\nOptional\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere?\n\n\nAs the value for the \nformat\n keyword in any string property's subschema.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \npassword\n keyword can be used to specify the \nformat\n of a \nstring\n.

            "text": "The \"JSON schema\" format is built on top of JSON. This adds some special rules and keywords that are intended to facilitate the  description  of the format of data (whereas \"raw\" JSON is intended for storing data).  Here is an example of a JSON schema that defines a (simplified) US address:  { \n     \"type\" :   \"object\" , \n     \"required\" :   [ \"name\" ,   \"streetNumber\" ,   \"street\" ,   \"city\" ,   \"state\" ,   \"zip5\" ], \n     \"additionalProperties\" :   false , \n     \"properties\" :   { \n         \"name\" :   {   \"type\" :   \"string\"   }, \n         \"streetNumber\" :   {   \"type\" :   \"string\"   }, \n         \"street\" :   {   \"type\" :   \"string\"   }, \n         \"unit\" :   {   \"type\" :   \"string\"   }, \n         \"city\" :   {   \"type\" :   \"string\" ,   \"pattern\" :   \"^[A-Z][A-Za-z ]*$\"   }, \n         \"state\" :   {   \"type\" :   \"string\" ,   \"pattern\" :   \"^[A-Z]{2}$\"   }, \n         \"zip5\" :   {   \"type\" :   \"string\" ,   \"pattern\" :   \"^[0-9]{5}\" }, \n         \"zipPlus4\" :   {   \"type\" :   \"string\" ,   \"pattern\" :   \"^[0-9]{4}\" } \n     }  }   Note that this is perfectly valid JSON data. It's a JSON object with four fields:  type  (a JSON string),  required  (A JSON array),  additionalProperties  (a JSON boolean), and  properties .  properties , in turn is a JSON object with with 8 fields, each of which is a JSON object, with its own properties, etc.  But, this isn't  just  a JSON object. This is a JSON schema. It uses special keywords like  type   required , and  additionalProperties . These have specially-defined meanings in the context of JSON schemas.  Here is a list of the special keywords used by the above schema. Note that this is only a small subset of JSON schema keywords.     keyword  description      additionalProperties  Determines whether the schema allows properties that are not explicitly listed in the  properties  specification. Must be a  true  or  false .    pattern  Used with string types to specify a regular expression that the property must conform to.    required  A list of required properties. Properties not listed in this list are optional.    string  Used with  type  to declare that a property must be a string.    type  Specifies a datatype. Common values are  object ,  array ,  number ,  integer ,  boolean , and  string .     Some points to note about the address schema above:   Because of the  required  list, all valid addresses must have fields called  name ,  streetNumber  and so on.  unit  and  zipPlus4  do not appear in the  required  list, and therefore are optional.  Because of  additionalProperties  being  false , valid addresses cannot make up their own fields like  nickname  or  doorbellLocation .  Because of the  pattern , any  state  field in a valid address must consist of exactly two capital letters.  Similarly,  city  must only contain letters and spaces, and  zip  and  zipPlus4  must only contain digits.  Each property has its own valid subschema that describes its own type definition.   Here is a JSON object that conforms to the above schema:  { \n   \"name\" :   \"Delphix\" , \n   \"streetNumber\" :   \"220\" , \n   \"street\" :   \"Congress St.\" , \n   \"unit\" :   \"200\" , \n   \"city\" :   \"Boston\" , \n   \"state\" :   \"MA\" , \n   \"zip\" :   \"02210\"  }    Info  A common point of confusion is the distinction between a JSON schema and a JSON object that conforms to a schema. Remember, a schema describes the form of data. In our example, the schema  describes  what an address looks like. The address itself is not a schema.   For much more detail on JSON schemas, including which keywords are available, what they mean, and where you can use them, see  https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/ .   Info  Be careful when using the JSON schema keyword  default . This keyword is commonly misunderstood. Specifically, it does not mean \"If the user does not provide a value, then this default value will be auto-substituted instead\", as you might expect. In fact, in JSON schemas,  default  has no semantic meaning at all! Currently, the only thing the Delphix Engine will use this for is to pre-fill widgets on the UI.",

At the top level of a repository or source config schema, at the same level as  type  and  properties .     The  identityFields  is a list of property names that, together, serve as a unique identifier for a repository or source config.  When a plugin's  automatic discovery  code is called, it will return a list of repositories (or source configs). The Delphix Engine needs to be able to compare this new list with whatever repositories it already knows about.  For example, suppose the engine already knows about a single repository with data  {\"dbname\": \"my_databsae\", \"path\": \"/var/db/db01\"}  (note the misspelling!). And, then suppose that automatic discovery is re-run and it returns repository data  { \"dbname\": \"my_database\", \"path\": \"/var/db/db01\"} .  What should the Delphix Engine do? Should it conclude that \"my_databsae\" has been deleted, and there is a completely new repository named \"my_database\"? Or, should it conclude that we still have the same old repository, but with an updated name?  identityFields  is used to handle this. When the engine compares \"new\" data with \"old\" data, it concludes that they belong to the same repository if  all  of the identity fields match. If any of the identity fields do not match, then the \"new\" repository data is judged to represent a different repository than the old data.  identityFields  is  required  for  RepositoryDefinition  and  SourceConfigDefinition  schemas, and may not be used in any other schemas.  In this example, we'll tell the Delphix Engine that  path  is the sole unique identifier.  { \n   \"properties\" :   { \n       \"dbname\" :   { \"type\" :   \"string\" }, \n       \"path\" :   { \"type\" :   \"string\" } \n   }, \n   \"identityFields\" :   [ \"path\" ]  }",

The aforementioned inputs and outputs are instances of these autogenerated classes.\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nAutogenerated Python code will use \nlower_case_with_underscores\n as attribute names as per Python variable naming conventions.\nThat is, if we were to use \nmountLocation\n as the schema property name, it would be called\n\nmount_location\n in the generated Python code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nNote that, wherever they can, these generated Python classes will enforce the constraints made by the schema. For example, if a property is listed as \nrequired\n in the schema, then every Python object will be required to always have this property.

            "text": "Logging\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhat is logging?\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Virtualization Platform keeps plugin-specific log files. A plugin can, at any point in any of its \nplugin operations\n, write out some text to its log file(s). These log files can be examined later, typically to try to debug a problem with the plugin.\n\n\nOverview\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Virtualization Platform integrates with Python's built-in \nlogging framework\n. A special \nHandler\n is exposed by the platform at \ndlpx.virtualization.libs.PlatformHandler\n. This handler needs to be added to the Python logger your plugin creates. Logging statements made through Python's logging framework will then be routed to the platform.\n\n\nBasic Setup\n\u00b6\n\n\nBelow is the absolute minimum needed to setup logging for the platform. Please refer to Python's \nlogging documentation\n and the \nexample below\n to better understand how it can be customized.\n\n\nimport\n \nlogging\n\n\n\nfrom\n \ndlpx.virtualization.libs\n \nimport\n \nPlatformHandler\n\n\n\n# Get the root logger.\n\n\nlogger\n \n=\n \nlogging\n.\ngetLogger\n()\n\n\nlogger\n.\naddHandler\n(\nPlatformHandler\n())\n\n\n\n# The root logger's default level is logging.WARNING.\n\n\n# Without the line below, logging statements of levels\n\n\n# lower than logging.WARNING will be suppressed.\n\n\nlogger\n.\nsetLevel\n(\nlogging\n.\nDEBUG\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogging Setup\n\n\nPython's logging framework is global. Setup only needs to happen once, but where it happens is important. Any logging statements that occur before the \nPlatformHandler\n is added will not be logged by the platform.\n\n\nIt is highly recommended that the logging setup is done in the plugin's entry point module before any operations are ran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the PlatformHandler to the root logger\n\n\nLoggers in Python have a hierarchy and all loggers are children of a special logger called the \"root logger\". Logging hierarchy is not always intuitive and depends on how modules are structured.\n\n\nTo avoid this complexity, add the \nPlatformHandler\n to the root logger. The root logger can be retrieved with \nlogging.getLogger()\n.\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce the \nPlatformHandler\n has been added to the logger, logging is done with Python's \nLogger\n object. Below is a simple example including the basic setup code used above:\n\n\nimport\n \nlogging\n\n\n\nfrom\n \ndlpx.virtualization.libs\n \nimport\n \nPlatformHandler\n\n\n\nlogger\n \n=\n \nlogging\n.\ngetLogger\n()\n\n\nlogger\n.\naddHandler\n(\nPlatformHandler\n())\n\n\n\n# The root logger's default level is logging.WARNING.\n\n\n# Without the line below, logging statements of levels\n\n\n# lower than logging.WARNING will be suppressed.\n\n\nlogger\n.\nsetLevel\n(\nlogging\n.\nDEBUG\n)\n\n\n\nlogger\n.\ndebug\n(\n'debug'\n)\n\n\nlogger\n.\ninfo\n(\n'info'\n)\n\n\nlogger\n.\nerror\n(\n'error'\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\u00b6\n\n\nImagine you notice that your plugin is taking a very long time to do discovery. Everything works, it just takes much longer than expected.

Any logging statements that occur before the  PlatformHandler  is added will not be logged by the platform.  It is highly recommended that the logging setup is done in the plugin's entry point module before any operations are ran.    Add the PlatformHandler to the root logger  Loggers in Python have a hierarchy and all loggers are children of a special logger called the \"root logger\". Logging hierarchy is not always intuitive and depends on how modules are structured.  To avoid this complexity, add the  PlatformHandler  to the root logger. The root logger can be retrieved with  logging.getLogger() .",

It is this artifact which is distributed to users, and which is installed onto engines.\n\n\nAutomatic Discovery\n\u00b6\n\n\nDiscovery\n which is done by the Delphix Engine (with help from a plugin) itself, with no need for the end user to provide any information.\n\n\nBuilding\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe process of creating an \nartifact\n from the collection of files that make up the plugin's source code.\n\n\nData Migration\n\u00b6\n\n\nA python function which is called as part of the upgrade process. It handles transforming data from an older format to a newer format. More details \nhere\n.\n\n\nData Migration ID\n\u00b6\n\n\nEach data migration is tagged with a unique ID. This allows the Delphix Engine to know which data migrations need to be run, in which order, when upgrading to a new plugin version. More details \nhere\n.\n\n\nDecorator\n\u00b6\n\n\nA Python construct which is used by plugins to \"tag\" certain functions, so that the Delphix Engine knows which function corresponds to which plugin operation.\n\n\nDirect Linking\n\u00b6\n\n\nA strategy that involves data being ingested directly from the source environment onto the Delphix Engine, without the assistance of a staging environment.\n\n\nDiscovery\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe process by which the Delphix Engine learns about how a particular environment can be used for ingesting or virtualizing datasets.\n\n\ndSource\n\u00b6\n\n\nSee \nLinked Dataset\n\n\nEmpty VDB\n\u00b6\n\n\nA VDB that is created from scratch, without provisioning from another dataset. Users can create empty VDBs when they want to construct a brand-new dataset from within Delphix, instead of creating it externally and then ingesting it.\n\n\nThis \"empty\" VDB, of course, will typically not stay empty for long. Data will be added as users work with the new dataset.\n\n\nA plugin can support this functionality by implementing the \ninitialize\n operation.\n\n\nEnvironment\n\u00b6\n\n\nA remote system that the Delphix Engine can interact with. An environment can be used as a \nsource\n, \nstaging\n or \ntarget\n environment (or any combination of those).  For example, a Linux machine that the Delphix Engine can connect to is an environment.\n\n\nEnvironment User\n\u00b6\n\n\nA set of user credentials that the Delphix Engine can use to interact with an \nEnvironmnet\n. For example, a username and password to login to a Linux machine.\n\n\nLinked Dataset\n\u00b6\n\n\nA dataset on the Delphix Engine which holds an ingested copy of a pre-existing external dataset from a source environment. A linked dataset is often called a \ndSource\n.\n\n\nLinked Source\n\u00b6\n\n\nAn object on the Delphix Engine that holds information related to a \nlinked dataset\n.\n\n\nLinking\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe process by which the Delphix Engine connects a new \ndSource\n to a pre-existing dataset on a source environment.\n\n\nLogging\n\u00b6\n\n\nLogging is when a plugin writes out some human-readable information to a log file. The log file can then be examined, typically in order to debug a problem with the plugin.\n\n\nPlugin Config\n\u00b6\n\n\nA \nYAML\n file containing a list of plugin properties: What is the plugin's name? What version of the plugin is this? Etc. More details \nhere\n.\n\n\nManual Discovery\n\u00b6\n\n\nDiscovery\n which the end user does by manually entering the necessary information into the Delphix Engine.\n\n\nMount Specification\n\u00b6\n\n\nA collection of information, provided by the plugin, which give all the details about how and where \nvirtual datasets\n should be mounted onto \ntarget environments\n. This term is often shortened to \"Mount Spec\".\n\n\nPassword Properties\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn \nschemas\n, any string property can be tagged with \n\"format\": \"password\"\n. This will let the Delphix Engine know that the property contains sensitive information. Any such values will only be stored in encrypted format, and the UI will not display the values on screen.\n\n\nPlatform Libraries\n\u00b6\n\n\nA set of Python functions that are provided by the Virtualization Platform. Plugins use these library functions to request that the Virtualization Platform do some task on behalf of the plugin. For example, running a Bash command on an environment, or making an log entry.\n\n\nPlugin\n\u00b6\n\n\nA tool that customizes the Delphix Engine so it knows how to interact with a particular kind of dataset.\n\n\nPlugin Operation\n\u00b6\n\n\nA piece of functionality that provided by a plugin in order to customize Delphix Engine behavior to work with a particular kind of dataset. A plugin operation is implemented as a Python function.\nFor example, a MySQL plugin might provide an operation called \"stop\" which knows how to stop a MySQL database.\n\n\nProvisioning\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe process of making a virtual copy of a dataset and making it available for use on a target environment.\n\n\nReplication\n\u00b6\n\n\nDelphix allows end users to replicate data objects between Delphix Engines by creating a replication profile.

The most common example of this is a database password.\n\n\nPlugins must be careful to handle sensitive data appropriately. Three tips for handling sensitive data are:\n\n\n\n\nTell the Delphix Engine which parts of your data are sensitive.\n\n\nWhen passing sensitive data to remote plugin library functions (such as \nrun_bash\n), use environment variables.\n\n\nAvoid logging, or otherwise writing out the sensitive data.\n\n\n\n\nEach of these tips are explained below.\n\n\nMarking Your Data As Sensitive\n\u00b6\n\n\nBecause the Delphix Engine manages the storing and retrieving of plugin-defined data, it needs to know which pieces of data are sensitive. The plugin does this in its \nschemas\n, by using the special \npassword\n keyword.\n\n\nThe following example of a schema defines an object with three properties, one of which is sensitive and tagged with the \npassword\n keyword:\n\n\n{\n\n    \n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"object\"\n,\n\n    \n\"properties\"\n:\n \n{\n\n        \n\"db_connectionPort\"\n:\n \n{\n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n},\n\n        \n\"db_username\"\n:\n \n{\n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n},\n\n        \n\"db_password\"\n:\n \n{\n\"type\"\n:\n \n\"string\"\n,\n \n\"format\"\n:\n \n\"password\"\n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis tells the Delphix Engine to take special precautions with this password property, as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThe Delphix Engine will encrypt the password before storing it, and decrypt it only as necessary to pass back to the plugin.\n\n\nThe Delphix Engine will not write this password anywhere (for example, it will not appear in any system logs).\n\n\nThe Delphix Engine's UI and CLI will not display the password.\n\n\nClients of the Delphix Engine's public API will not be able to access the password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nRemoving a previously added password property from a field and running a \nData Migration\n will expose the password in plaintext. If this is intentional, write a migration to ensure that the new property conforms to the new schema.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Environment Variables For Remote Data Passing\n\u00b6\n\n\nSometimes, a plugin will need to pass sensitive data to a remote environment. For example, perhaps a database command needs to be run on a \nstaging environment\n, and that database command will need to use a password.\n\n\nExample\n\u00b6\n\n\nLet us take a look at a very simple example where we need to shutdown a database called \"inventory\" on a target environment by using the \ndb_cmd shutdown inventory\n command. This command will ask for a password on \nstdin\n, and for our example our password is \"hunter2\".\n\n\nIf we were running this command by hand, it might look like this:\n\n\n$ db_cmd shutdown inventory\nConnecting to database instance...\nPlease enter database password:\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, we would type in \"hunter2\", and the command would proceed to shut down the database.\n\n\nSince a plugin cannot type in the password by hand, it will do something like this instead:\n\n\n$ \necho\n \n\"hunter2\"\n \n|\n db_cmd shutdown inventory\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Do This\n\u00b6\n\n\nFirst, let us take a look at how \nnot\n to do this! Here is a bit of plugin python code that will run the above command.\n\n\nfrom\n \ndlpx.virtualization\n \nimport\n \nlibs\n\n\nfrom\n \ndlpx.virtualization.platform\n \nimport\n \nPlugin\n\n\n\nplugin\n \n=\n \nPlugin\n()\n\n\n\n@plugin\n.\nvirtual\n.\nstop\n()\n\n\ndef\n \nmy_virtual_stop\n(\nvirtual_source\n,\n \nrepository\n,\n \nsource_config\n):\n\n  \n# THIS IS INSECURE! DO NOT DO THIS!\n\n  \nfull_command\n \n=\n \n\"echo \n{}\n | db_cmd shutdown \n{}\n\"\n.\nformat\n(\npassword\n,\n \ndb_name\n)\n\n  \nlibs\n.\nrun_bash\n(\nvirtual_source\n.\nconnection\n,\n \nfull_command\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis constructs a Python string containing exactly the desired command from above. However, this is not recommended.\n\n\nThe problem here is that there is a cleartext password in the Python string. But, this Python string is not treated as sensitive by the Virtualization Platform. For example, suppose the Virtualization Platform cannot make a connection to the target environment. In which case, it will raise an error containing the Python string, so that people will know what command failed. But, in our example, that would result in the password being part of the cleartext error message.\n\n\nUsing Environment Variables\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Delphix Engine provides a better way to pass sensitive data to remote bash (or powershell) calls: environment variables. Let us look at a different way to run the same command as above.\n\n\nfrom\n \ndlpx.virtualization\n \nimport\n \nlibs\n\n\nfrom\n \ndlpx.virtualization.platform\n \nimport\n \nPlugin\n\n\n\nplugin\n \n=\n \nPlugin\n()\n\n\n\n@plugin\n.\nvirtual\n.\nstop\n()\n\n  \n# Use environment variables to pass sensitive data to remote commands\n\n  \nenvironment_vars\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \n\"DATABASE_PASSWORD\"\n \n:\n \npassword\n\n  \n}\n\n  \nfull_command\n \n=\n \n\"echo $DATABASE_PASSWORD | db_cmd shutdown \n{}\n\"\n.\nformat\n(\ndb_name\n)\n\n  \nlibs\n.\nrun_bash\n(\nvirtual_source\n.\nconnection\n,\n \nfull_command\n,\n \nvariables\n=\nenvironment_vars\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWe are no longer putting the cleartext password into the Python command string. Instead, we are instructing the Virtualization Platform to put the password into an environment variable on the target environment. The Python command string merely mentions the name of the environment variable, and does not contain the password itself.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the command runs on the target environment, Bash will substitute in the password, and the database shutdown will run as expected.\n\n\nUnlike with the command string, the Virtualization Platform \ndoes\n treat environment variables as sensitive information, and will not include them in error messages or internal logs, etc.\n\n\nDon't Write Out Sensitive Data\n\u00b6\n\n\nPlugin writers are strongly advised to never write out unencrypted sensitive data. This is common-sense general advice that applies to all areas of programming, not just for plugins. However, there are a couple of special concerns for plugins.\n\n\nThe Virtualization Platform provides logging capabilities to plugins. The generated logs are unencrypted and not treated as sensitive. Therefore, it is important for plugins to \nnever log sensitive data\n.\n\n\nIn addition, remember that your plugin is not treated as sensitive by the Virtualization Platform. Plugin code is distributed unencrypted, and is viewable in cleartext by Delphix Engine users. Sensitive data such as passwords should never be hard-coded in your plugin code.",
