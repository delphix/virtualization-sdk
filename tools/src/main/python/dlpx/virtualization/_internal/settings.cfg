# Until Gradle is removed, unfortunately there are two places the version
# is specified. The build.gradle file in the root contains the version
# that is used when creating a distribution for the package. This
# version is used during dvp runtime. One example of this is displaying
# the version in dvp --version. Another is during dvp build this version
# is used to install the wrappers that are bundled with the plugin.
#
# package_version is the version of the tools package.
#
# This package follows semantic versioning.
# More can be read here: https://semver.org/
#
# This package is currently shipped in band with the virtualization.libs
# and virtualization.platform packages. This version should match the
# versions in those packages until they are shipped out of band.
