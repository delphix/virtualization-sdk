## Status

An enum used to represent the state of a linked or virtual source and whether it is functioning as expected.

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import Status

status = Status.ACTIVE
```

### Values

Value | Description
----- | -----------
ACTIVE | Source is healthy and functioning as expected.
INACTIVE | Source is not functioning as expected.

## Mount

Represents a mount exported and mounted to a remote host.

```python

mount_path | String | The path on the remote host that has the mounted data set.
shared_path | String | **Optional.** The path of the subdirectory of the data set to mount to the remote host.


## OwnershipSpecification

Represents how to set the ownership for a data set. This only applies to Unix Hosts.

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import OwnershipSpecification

ownership_specification = OwnershipSpecification(uid, gid)
```

### Fields

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | -----------
uid | Integer | The user id to set the ownership of the data set to.
gid | Integer | The group id to set the ownership of the data set to.

## MountSpecification

Represents properties for the mount associated with an exported data set.

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import MountSpecification

mount_specification = MountSpecification([mount], ownership_specification)
```

### Fields

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | -----------
mounts | list[[Mount](#mount)] | The list of mounts to export the data sets to.
ownership_specification | [OwnershipSpecification](#ownershipspecification) | **Optional.** Control the ownership attributes for the data set. It defaults to the environment user of the remote environment if it is not specified.

## SnapshotParametersDefinition

User provided parameters for the snapshot operation. It includes a boolean property named `resync` that can be used to indicate to the plugin whether or not to initiate a full ingestion of the dSource. The parameters are only set during a manual snapshot. When using a sync policy, `resync` defaults to `false`.

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import Plugin

plugin = Plugin()

@plugin.linked.pre_snapshot()
def linked_pre_snapshot(staged_source, repository, source_config, snapshot_parameters):
  if snapshot_parameter.resync:
      print(snapshot_parameter.resync)
```

> This class will be generated during build and is located with the autogenerated classes. As it is passed into the operation, importing it is not neccessary.

### Fields

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | -----------
resync | Boolean | Determines if this snapshot should ingest the dSource from scratch.

## RemoteEnvironment
