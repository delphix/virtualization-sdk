## Lua Repository Data Migration

A Lua Repository [Data Migration](/References/Glossary.md#data-migration) migrates repository data from an older [schema](/References/Glossary.md#schema) format defined originally from a lua toolkit to an updated schema format defined in the Python plugin.

### Required / Optional
**Optional.**<br/>

!!! warning
    You must ensure that all repository data will match your updated repository schema after an upgrade operation. Depending on how your schema has changed, this might imply that you need to write one or more repository data migrations.

### Delphix Engine Operations

* [Upgrade](/References/Workflows.md#upgrade)

### Signature

`def migrate_repository(old_repository)`

### Decorator

`upgrade.repository(lua_version, MigrationType.LUA)`

### Decorator Arguments

Argument | Type | Description
-------- | ---- | -----------
lua_version | String | The lua version of the migration that the upgrade would be migrating from. This is the ID of this migration. The version here is actually just the major and minor version of the lua toolkit therefore each defined migration's lua_version per repository data migration must be unique.
migration_type | String | This migration type field indicates whether the operation is lua or just a regular data migration. Signify this as LUA so that the major minor version can be used. If not defined, this operation will default to a regular [repository data migration](/References/Plugin_Operations.md#repository-data-migration).

### Function Arguments
Argument | Type | Description
-------- | ---- | -----------
old_repository | Dictionary | The plugin-specific data associated with a repository, that conforms to the previous schema defined in lua.

!!! warning
    The function argument `old_repository` is a Python dictionary, where each property name appears exactly as described in the previous repository schema. This differs from non-upgrade-related operations, where the function arguments are [autogenerated classes](/References/Schemas_and_Autogenerated_Classes.md) based on the schema.


### Returns
Dictionary<br/>
A migrated version of the `old_repository` input that must conform to the updated repository schema.

### Example
```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import Plugin

plugin = Plugin()

@plugin.upgrade.repository("1.1", MigrationType.LUA)
def add_new_flag_to_repo(old_repository):
  new_repository = dict(old_repository)
  new_repository["useNewFeature"] = False
  return new_repository
```

## Lua Source Config Data Migration

A Lua Source Config [Data Migration](/References/Glossary.md#data-migration) migrates source config data from an older [schema](/References/Glossary.md#schema) format defined originally from a lua toolkit to an updated schema format defined in the Python plugin.

### Required / Optional
**Optional.**<br/>

!!! warning
    You must ensure that all source config data will match your source config schema after an upgrade operation. Depending on how your schema has changed, this might imply that you need to write one or more source config data migrations.

### Delphix Engine Operations

* [Upgrade](/References/Workflows.md#upgrade)

### Signature

`def migrate_source_config(old_source_config)`

### Decorator

`upgrade.source_config(lua_version, MigrationType.LUA)`

### Decorator Arguments

Argument | Type | Description
-------- | ---- | -----------
lua_version | String | The lua version of the migration that the upgrade would be migrating from. This is the ID of this migration. The version here is actually just the major and minor version of the lua toolkit therefore each defined migration's lua_version per source config data migration must be unique.
migration_type | String | This migration type field indicates whether the operation is lua or just a regular data migration. Signify this as LUA so that the major minor version can be used. If not defined, this operation will default to a regular [source config data migration](/References/Plugin_Operations.md#source-config-data-migration).

### Function Arguments
Argument | Type | Description
-------- | ---- | -----------
old_source_config | Dictionary | The plugin-specific data associated with a source config, that conforms to the previous schema.

!!! warning
    The function argument `old_source_config` is a Python dictionary, where each property name appears exactly as described in the previous source config schema. This differs from non-upgrade-related operations, where the function arguments are [autogenerated classes](/References/Schemas_and_Autogenerated_Classes.md) based on the schema.


### Returns
Dictionary<br/>
A migrated version of the `old_source_config` input that must conform to the updated source config schema.

### Example
```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import Plugin

plugin = Plugin()

@plugin.upgrade.source_config("1.1", MigrationType.LUA)

### Required / Optional
**Optional.**<br/>

!!! warning
    You must ensure that all linked source data will match your linked source schema after an upgrade operation. Depending on how your schema has changed, this might imply that you need to write one or more linked source data migrations.
