# Release - v2.1.0

To install or upgrade the SDK, refer to instructions [here](/Getting_Started.md#installation).

## New & Improved

* Added the ability to migrate existing Lua toolkits to plugins.
    * [Convert](/Versioning_And_Upgrade/Lua_Toolkit_To_SDK_Plugin_Migration/Converting_Migration_Scripts.md) any existing Lua upgrade scripts to Python migrations by using our new Lua upgrade [decorators](/Versioning_And_Upgrade/Lua_Toolkit_To_SDK_Plugin_Migration/Decorators.md).
    * Added new fields `luaName` and `minimumLuaVersion` to the [Plugin Config](/Versioning_And_Upgrade/Lua_Toolkit_To_SDK_Plugin_Migration/Plugin_Config.md). These properties allow a plugin to specify which Lua toolkit(s) the plugin can upgrade.

    More details about Lua Upgrade can be found [here](/Versioning_And_Upgrade/Lua_Toolkit_To_SDK_Plugin_Migration/Overview.md).
