# Breaking Changes - GA (v.2.0.0)

## Plugin Config Field Renamed
The following field in the [Plugin Config](../../References/Plugin_Config.md) were replaced:

| Previous | Updated |
| -------- | ------- |
| `version` | `buildNumber` |

Additionally, the `buildNumber` must be a string that conforms to the following rules:

* The string must be composed of a sequence of non-negative integers, not all zero, separated by periods.
* Trailing zeros are ignored. So, "1.0.0" is treated the same as "1".
* Build numbers are sortable numerically, with earlier numbers having more significance than later numbers. So, "2.0" comes after "1.99999", and "1.10" comes after "1.2".
* The Delphix Engine will never allow installation of plugin with a build number that is ordered before the the already-installed build number.


More details about the format are [here](../../Versioning_And_Upgrade/Versioning.md#build-number-format-rules).

### What is affected
All plugins built with v1.0.0 or below will be affected. The [Plugin Config](../../References/Plugin_Config.md) field `version` will have to be updated to `buildNumber`.

### How does it fail
[dvp build](../../References/CLI.md#build) will fail with the following error message if the [Plugin Config](../../References/Plugin_Config.md) `version` field is not updated to `buildNumber`:

```bash
$ dvp build
Error: Additional properties are not allowed ('version' was unexpected) on ['additionalProperties']
Error: 'buildNumber' is a required property on ['required']

Validation failed on /private/var/tmp/fp/plugin_config.yml. 
0 Warning(s). 2 Error(s) 

BUILD FAILED.
```

### How to fix it
Rename the [Plugin Config](../../References/Plugin_Config.md) `version` field to `buildNumber`. Make sure that the `buildNumber ` conforms to the format described [here](../../Versioning_And_Upgrade/Versioning.md#build-number-format-rules).
