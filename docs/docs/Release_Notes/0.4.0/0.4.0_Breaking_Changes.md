# Breaking Changes - Early Preview 2 (v.0.4.0)

## New Argument `snapshot_parameters`
A new argument `snapshot_parameters` was added to the following **staged** plugin operations:

* [Staged Linked Source Pre-Snapshot](../../References/Plugin_Operations.md#staged-linked-source-pre-snapshot)
* [Staged Linked Source Post-Snapshot](../../References/Plugin_Operations.md#staged-linked-source-post-snapshot)

This argument will allow the end user to indicate to the plugin whether or not to initiate a full ingestion for a dSource. More details about the new argument are [here](../../Building_Your_First_Plugin/Data_Ingestion.md).

### What is affected
This argument applies only to **staged** plugins. The plugin's source code will have to be updated for the following staged plugin operations:

* [Staged Linked Source Pre-Snapshot](../../References/Plugin_Operations.md#staged-linked-source-pre-snapshot): This plugin operation is optional and will need to be updated if the plugin implements it.
* [Staged Linked Source Post-Snapshot](../../References/Plugin_Operations.md#staged-linked-source-post-snapshot): This plugin operation is required and will need to be updated.

### How does it fail
[build](../../References/CLI.md#build) will fail with the following error message if the new argument is not added to the affected staged plugin operations:

```bash
$ dvp build
Error: Number of arguments do not match in method staged_post_snapshot. Expected: ['staged_source', 'repository', 'source_config', 'snapshot_parameters'], Found: ['repository', 'source_config', 'staged_source'].
Error: Number of arguments do not match in method staged_pre_snapshot. Expected: ['staged_source', 'repository', 'source_config', 'snapshot_parameters'], Found: ['repository', 'source_config', 'staged_source'].

0 Warning(s). 2 Error(s).

BUILD FAILED.
```

### How to fix it
Update the affected staged plugin operations to include the new argument `snapshot_parameters`.

* Previous releases

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import Plugin

plugin = Plugin()

@plugin.linked.pre_snapshot()
def linked_pre_snapshot_prior(staged_source, repository, source_config):
  # This was the function signature prior to 0.4.0
  pass

@plugin.linked.post_snapshot()
def linked_post_snapshot_prior(staged_source, repository, source_config):
  # This was the function signature prior to 0.4.0
  return SnapshotDefinition()
```

* 0.4.0

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import Plugin

plugin = Plugin()

@plugin.linked.pre_snapshot()
def linked_pre_snapshot_040(staged_source, repository, source_config, snapshot_parameters):
  # Updated function signature in 0.4.0
  pass

@plugin.linked.post_snapshot()
def linked_post_snapshot_040(staged_source, repository, source_config, snapshot_parameters):
  # Updated function signature in 0.4.0
  return SnapshotDefinition()

```

## StagedSource Properties Modified
Properties of the [StagedSource](../../References/Classes.md#stagedsource) class were modified:

* `connection` was renamed to `source_connection`.
* `staged_connection` was added to allow connecting to the staging environment.

This will enable plugins to connect to both the source and staging environments. More details about these properties are [here](../../References/Classes.md#stagedsource).

### What is affected
This change applies only to **staged** plugins.<br/>

#### Required Changes
The plugin's source code will have to be updated for any staged plugin operations that accesses the `connection` propery of a [StagedSource](../../References/Classes.md#stagedsource) object.

#### Optional Changes
The plugin can choose to use the new `staged_connection` property to connect to the staging environment of a dSource.

### How does it fail
Any Delphix Engine operation that calls a plugin operation that has not been fixed would fail with the following stack trace as part of the output of the user exception:

```python
AttributeError: 'StagedSource' object has no attribute 'connection'
```

### How to fix it
Update any staged plugin operations that access the renamed property.

* Previous releases

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import Plugin
from dlpx.virtualization import libs

plugin = Plugin()

@plugin.linked.pre_snapshot()
def linked_pre_snapshot_prior(staged_source, repository, source_config):
  # Property name was 'connection' was the name of the property for staged_source prior to 0.4.0
  libs.run_bash(staged_source.connection, 'date')
```

* 0.4.0

```python
from dlpx.virtualization.platform import Plugin
from dlpx.virtualization import libs

plugin = Plugin()

@plugin.linked.pre_snapshot()
def linked_pre_snapshot_prior(staged_source, repository, source_config):
  # Property name was updated to 'source_connection' in 0.4.0
  libs.run_bash(staged_source.source_connection, 'date')
```
